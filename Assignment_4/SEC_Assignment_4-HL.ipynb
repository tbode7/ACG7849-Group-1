Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

(1)Market rank represents the relative size of the television market in the United States.(2)Stations in Market represents stations within the Designated Market Area per the Nielsen survey excluding public broadcasting stations, satellite stations, and low-power stations.(3)Station Rank in Market is based on Average Share as described in (5). (4)Percentage of U.S. Television Households in Market represents the number of U.S. television households in Designated Market Area as a percentage of total U.S. television households.(5)Average Audience Share represents the number of television households tuned to a specific station from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday-Sunday, as a percentage of total viewing households in the Designated Market Area.(6)Affiliation agreements expired and were extended or are being negotiated at this writing.Historically, we have been successful in renewing our FCC licenses.  We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands.

In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media.

In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services.

NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows.

NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton.

In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage. For its advertising technology platform, Triton charges a fixed license fee with additional fees based on the number of impressions delivered. Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media. Various labor unions represent approximately 400 employees, the majority of which are in Local Media. We have not experienced any work stoppages at our current operations since 1985. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory.12<font style=\"font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold;\"', '>Item\\xa01.BusinessWe are an 140-year-old media enterprise with interests in local and national media brands. Founded in 1878, our motto is \"Give light and the people will find their own way.\" Our mission is to do well by doing good — creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve. We serve audiences and businesses in our Local Media division through a portfolio of local television stations and their associated digital media products. Our Local Media division is one of the nation’s largest independent TV station ownership groups. Following the completion of the Raycom Media acquisition in January 2019 and the anticipated closing of the Cordillera Communications, LLC acquisition in the second quarter of 2019, we will have 51 television stations in 36 markets and a reach of more than one in five U.S. television households. We have affiliations with all of the “Big Four” television networks. In our National Media division, we operate national media brands including podcast industry-leader, Stitcher, and its advertising network Midroll Media; next-generation national news network, Newsy; four national broadcast networks, the Katz networks; and the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, Triton. We also operate an award-winning investigative reporting newsroom in Washington, D.C., and serve as the longtime steward of one of the nation\\'s largest, most successful and longest-running educational programs, the Scripps National Spelling Bee. For a full listing of our outlets, visit http://www.scripps.com. In 2018, management announced a comprehensive growth strategy for the Company to improve short-term performance and position itself for long-term growth in the form of a five-point plan. The strategy began at the end of 2017 with a reorganization of our Company into Local Media and National Media divisions to better reflect how audiences and advertisers view our businesses. We performed an analysis of our operating divisions and corporate cost structure in order to reduce expenses and improve both operating performance and company cash flow. We have incurred restructuring charges totaling $13.3 million since the third quarter of 2017 and have completed our plan to achieve $30 million in annualized cost reductions. We executed on further optimizing our portfolio through the sale of our radio business. By the end of 2018, all 34 radio stations had been sold through multiple transactions for total consideration of $83.5 million. We continue to pursue a television station acquisition strategy that allows us to assemble the best-performing portfolio possible. On January 1, 2019, we acquired ABC-affiliated stations in Waco, Texas and Tallahassee, Florida for $55 million in cash. Additionally, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 15 top ranked and high performing television stations, serving 10 markets, for $521 million. Completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated to close in the second quarter of 2019, is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. These acquisitions allow us to move into new markets that enhance our portfolio and will diversify our network affiliate mix. We also are committed to the continued investment in our national media businesses for long-term growth. On November\\xa030, 2018, we acquired Triton Digital Canada, Inc., a leading global digital audio infrastructure and audience measurement services company, for $150 million, net of cash acquired. We have increased our Newsy cable subscribers, Stitcher podcast listeners and Katz U.S. household reach through our investment in and creation of quality content. Additionally, during 2018, we delivered value to shareholders through our share repurchase program and initiation of a quarterly dividend of 5 cents per share. Financial information for each of our business segments can be found under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. 4LOCAL MEDIAOur Local Media segment is comprised of our local broadcast television stations and their related digital operations. We have operated broadcast television stations since 1947, when we launched Ohio’s first television station, WEWS, in Cleveland. Today, our television station group reaches approximately one in five of the nation’s television households and includes fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, two FOX affiliates and two CBS affiliates. We also have two MyTV affiliates, one CW affiliate, two independent stations and four Azteca America Spanish-language affiliates. We produce high-quality news, information and entertainment content that informs and engages our local communities. We distribute our content on four platforms — broadcast, Internet, smartphones and tablets. It is our objective to develop content and applications designed to enhance the user experience on each of those platforms. Our ability to cover our communities across multiple digital platforms allows us to expand our audiences beyond our traditional broadcast television boundaries.We believe the most critical component of our product mix is compelling news content, which is an important link to the community and aids our stations\\' efforts to retain and expand viewership. We have trained employees in our news departments to be multi-media journalists, allowing us to pursue a “hyper-local” strategy by having more reporters covering local news for our over-the-air and digital platforms. In addition to news programming, our television stations run network programming, syndicated programming and original programming. Our strategy is to rely less on expensive syndicated programming and to replace it with original programming that we control. We believe this strategy improves our Local Media division\\'s financial performance. Original shows we produce ourselves or in partnership with others include:•The List, an Emmy award winning infotainment show, is available in 37 markets reaching viewers in approximately 28 percent of the country.•The Now is a news show designed to take the audience into a deeper dive of the day\\'s events and is available in more than 15 of our markets. •RightThisMinute is a daily news and entertainment program featuring viral videos. RightThisMinute reaches nearly 97 percent of the nation\\'s television households. 5Information concerning our full-power television stations, their network affiliations and the markets in which they operate is as follows:Station\\xa0Market\\xa0NetworkAffiliation/DTV Channel\\xa0Affiliation Agreement Expires in\\xa0FCCLicenseExpires in\\xa0Market Rank (1)\\xa0Stationsin Market (2)\\xa0Station Rank in Market (3)\\xa0Percentageof U.S.Television Householdsin Mkt (4)\\xa0AverageAudience Share (5)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0WFTS-TV\\xa0Tampa, Ch. 28\\xa0ABC/29\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa011\\xa013\\xa04\\xa01.7%\\xa04KNXV-TV\\xa0Phoenix, Ch. 15\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa012\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.7%\\xa05WMYD-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 20\\xa0MY/21\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa06\\xa01.6%\\xa02WXYZ-TV\\xa0Detroit, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/41\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa014\\xa010\\xa02\\xa01.6%\\xa07KMGH-TV\\xa0Denver, Ch. 7\\xa0ABC/7\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa017\\xa014\\xa03\\xa01.4%\\xa04WEWS-TV\\xa0Cleveland, Ch. 5\\xa0ABC/15\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa019\\xa011\\xa01\\xa01.3%\\xa08WMAR-TV\\xa0Baltimore, Ch. 2\\xa0ABC/38\\xa02022\\xa02020\\xa026\\xa011\\xa04\\xa01.0%\\xa03WTVF-TV\\xa0Nashville, Ch. 5\\xa0CBS/25\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa027\\xa010\\xa01\\xa00.9%\\xa013WRTV-TV\\xa0Indianapolis, Ch. 6\\xa0ABC/25\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa028\\xa010\\xa04\\xa00.9%\\xa05KGTV-TV\\xa0San Diego, Ch. 10\\xa0ABC/10\\xa02022\\xa02022\\xa029\\xa012\\xa03\\xa00.9%\\xa05KMCI-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 38\\xa0Ind./41\\xa0N/A\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa07\\xa00.8%\\xa01KSHB-TV\\xa0Kansas City, Ch. 41\\xa0NBC/42\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa032\\xa012\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WCPO-TV\\xa0Cincinnati, Ch. 9\\xa0ABC/22\\xa02022\\xa02021\\xa035\\xa09\\xa03\\xa00.8%\\xa07WTMJ-TV\\xa0Milwaukee, Ch. 4\\xa0NBC/28\\xa02021\\xa02021\\xa036\\xa014\\xa04\\xa00.8%\\xa06WPTV-TV\\xa0W.

We operate four low-power stations affiliated with the Azteca America network, a Hispanic network producing Spanish-language programming. The stations are clustered around our Bakersfield and Denver stations. We also operate a low-power station affiliated with ABC in Twin Falls, ID and a low-power independent station in San Diego. 6Revenue cycles and sourcesCore Advertising Our core advertising is comprised of sales to local and national customers. The advertising includes a combination of broadcast air spots, as well as digital advertising. Our core advertising revenues accounted for 51% of our Local Media segment’s revenues in 2018. Pricing of broadcast spot advertising is based on audience size and share, the demographics of our audiences and the demand for our limited inventory of commercial time. Our stations compete for advertising revenues with other sources of local media, including competitors’ television stations in the same markets, radio stations, cable television systems, newspapers, digital platforms and direct mail.Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include advertisers such as car dealerships, health-care facilities and other service providers. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and to increase the amount of advertising sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or promoting local events and activities. National advertising time is generally sold through national sales representative firms that call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies and insurance providers. Digital revenues are primarily generated from the sale of advertising to local and national customers on our local television websites, smartphone apps, tablet apps and other platforms. Cyclical factors influence revenues from our core advertising categories. Some of the cycles are periodic and known well in advance, such as election campaign seasons and special programming events (e.g. the Olympics or the Super Bowl). For example, our NBC affiliates benefit from incremental advertising demand from the coverage of the Olympics. Economic cycles are less predictable and beyond our control.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.Political AdvertisingPolitical advertising is generally sold through our Washington D.C. sales office. Advertising is sold to presidential, gubernatorial, Senate and House of Representative candidates, as well as for state and local issues. It is also sold to political action groups (PACs) or other advocacy groups. Political advertising revenues were 15% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018.Political advertising revenues increase significantly during even-numbered years when local, state and federal elections occur. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising for the presidential election. Because of the cyclical nature of the political election cycle, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing the performance in even-numbered years to that in odd-numbered years. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number, importance and competitiveness of individual political races and issues discussed in our local markets. Retransmission RevenuesWe earn revenues from retransmission consent agreements with multi-channel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\") in our markets. Retransmission revenues were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s revenues in 2018. The MVPDs are cable operators, telecommunication companies and satellite carriers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers the MVPD has in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.We also receive fees from over-the-top (virtual MVPDs) such as YouTubeTV, DirectTV Now and Sony Vue. The fees we receive are typically based on the number of subscribers in our local market and the contracted rate per subscriber.7ExpensesEmployee costs accounted for 44% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018.We centralize certain functions, such as master control, traffic, graphics and political advertising, at company-owned hubs that do not require a presence in the local markets. This approach enables each of our stations to focus local resources on the creation of content and revenue-producing activities. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to centralize functions that do not require a local market presence. Programming costs, which include network affiliation fees, syndicated programming and shows produced for us or in partnership with others, were 33% of our Local Media segment\\'s costs and expenses in 2018. Our network-affiliated stations broadcast programming that is supplied to us by the networks in various dayparts. Under each affiliation agreement, the station broadcasts all of the programs transmitted by the network. In exchange, we pay affiliation fees to the network and the network sells a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect our network affiliation agreements to be renewed upon expiration.Federal Regulation of Broadcasting — Broadcast television is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC and empowers the FCC to revoke, modify and renew broadcast licenses, approve the transfer of control of any entity holding such a license, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by stations and adopt and enforce necessary regulations. As part of its obligation to ensure that broadcast licensees serve the public interest, the FCC exercises limited authority over broadcast programming by, among other things, requiring certain children\\'s television programming and limiting commercial content therein, requiring the identification of program sponsors, regulating the sale of political advertising and the distribution of emergency information, and restricting indecent programming. The FCC also requires television broadcasters to close caption their programming for the benefit of persons with hearing impairment and to ensure that any of their programming that is later transmitted via the Internet is captioned. Network-affiliated television broadcasters in larger markets must also offer audio narration of certain programming for the benefit of persons with visual impairments. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, the FCC’s rules and regulations, and the FCC’s public notices and published decisions for a fuller description of the FCC’s extensive regulation of broadcasting.Broadcast licenses are granted for a term of up to eight years and are renewable upon request, subject to FCC review of the licensee\\'s performance. All the Company’s applications for license renewal during the current renewal cycle have been granted for full terms. While there can be no assurance regarding the renewal of our broadcast licenses, we have never had a license revoked, have never been denied a renewal, and all previous renewals have been for the maximum term.FCC regulations govern the ownership of television stations, and the agency is required by statute to periodically review these rules. In November 2017, the FCC adopted significant changes to its local television ownership rules. In particular, the FCC voted to relax the television “duopoly rule” that generally restricted an applicant from owning or controlling more than one television station (or in some markets under certain conditions, more than two television stations) in the same market. The FCC eliminated that rule’s requirement that eight independent local television station “voices” should remain after any merger, and it relaxed the prohibition against common ownership of two of the four most-viewed stations in a market, stating that proposed mergers of such “top-four” stations will instead be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The order further reversed an earlier FCC decision to treat those stations participating in joint advertising sales agreements as if they were under common ownership. Station WSYM-TV, Lansing, Michigan, is a party to such a joint advertising agreement with a local station, but it enjoyed a permitted “grandfathered” status while the rule was in effect. These rule changes remain subject to pending appeals and further judicial review.  This 2017 FCC order left in place the long-standing requirement that any television station that provides more than 15% of another in-market television station’s weekly programming is deemed to have an attributable interest in that station that subjects the stations to the FCC’s ownership limits. It also directed that any local stations that share facilities or services such as program production on a continuing basis must start disclosing these agreements in their public files. Stations WPTV-TV, West Palm Beach, Florida, and KIVI-TV, Nampa (Boise), Idaho, are parties to such shared services programming agreements. With respect to national television ownership, the FCC voted in December 2017 to consider whether and how it might revisit its rule preventing applicants from obtaining an ownership interest in television stations whose total national audience reach would exceed 39% of all television households. Earlier in the year, the FCC reinstated the 50% discount applied to the number of households deemed covered by UHF television stations, and the new notice expressly addresses whether to retain this distinction for UHF. This proceeding remains open. 8In December 2018, the FCC began another of its statutorily-required reviews of its multiple ownership rule, including a broad review of whether all the current local radio and television rules continue to serve the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the pending court review of the FCC\\'s television ownership rule changes or the effect of further FCC rule revisions on our stations\\' operations or our business.The restrictions imposed by the FCC’s ownership rules may apply to a corporate licensee due to the ownership interests of its officers, directors or significant shareholders. If such parties meet the FCC’s criteria for holding an attributable interest in the licensee, they are likewise expected to comply with the ownership limits, as well as other licensee requirements such as compliance with certain criminal, antitrust, and antidiscrimination laws.In order to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband and other services, the FCC in 2017 conducted an incentive spectrum auction in which some television broadcasters agreed to voluntarily give up spectrum in return for a share of the auction proceeds. No Scripps station will be going off-air or relinquishing a current UHF-band allocation for a VHF-band allocation as a result of the auction, but 17 full-power Scripps stations and many of Scripps\\' low-power and translator stations are relocating to new channels in the reduced broadcast spectrum band. Broadcasters are concerned that the FCC’s approach to the post-auction “repacking” of the remaining television stations into this reduced broadcast spectrum may not adequately protect stations’ over-the-air services. Broadcasters also are particularly concerned that the FCC’s post-auction plans will not provide sufficient time to complete the repacking before the sold spectrum will be authorized for wireless use. Implementing the post-auction changes will be complicated and costly, and stations located near the Canadian and Mexican borders may be at particular risk of service loss due to the need to coordinate international frequency use. Despite warnings about difficulties, such as weather delays and a lack of available qualified tower and equipment installation crews, the FCC has expressed confidence that adequate time will be available to complete the repacking, and it has imposed a “hard” deadline that could require a station to cease broadcasting on its existing frequency even though an alternative facility is not yet ready to provide its over-the-air service.Broadcasters are currently testing a new voluntary digital television standard, ATSC 3.0. This Internet-protocol based transmission system will permit television stations to offer enhanced and innovative services coupled with much improved broadcast signal reception, particularly by mobile devices. The new standard, however, is incompatible with both existing television receivers and with a station’s ability to continue offering its service via the current ATSC 1.0 digital standard. To avoid loss of service to those viewers who lack a new receiver, stations switching to ATSC 3.0 will be required to arrange for a local station that continues to use the current 1.0 standard to air (on a subchannel) programming “substantially similar” to that offered by the switching station on its 3.0 channel. In return, the 3.0 station could host the 3.0 signal of its 1.0 “host” station. This “simulcasting” requirement will sunset in July 2023, unless extended by the FCC. Scripps Station KNXV-TV is participating in a market test of the new transmission system in Phoenix, AZ.  The FCC remains committed to permitting non-broadcast spectrum use in the “white spaces” between television stations\\' protected service areas despite broadcasters’ concerns about the possibility of harmful interference to their existing service and to the potential for innovative uses of their broadcast spectrum in the future. In connection with the auction process, the FCC may further reduce the spectrum available for television broadcasting by reserving a 6 MHz channel in each market for non-broadcast, unlicensed services (including wireless microphones). The repacking of television broadcast spectrum and the reservation of spectrum in the “broadcast” band for interference-protected non-broadcast services could have a particularly adverse effect on the ability of low-power and translator television stations to offer service since these stations may not be able to find space to operate in the reduced band and they enjoy only “secondary” status that offers no protection from interference caused by a full-power station. We cannot predict the effect of these proceedings on our offering of digital television service or our business.Full-power broadcast television stations generally enjoy “must-carry” rights on any cable television system defined as “local” with respect to the station. Stations may waive their must-carry rights and instead negotiate retransmission consent agreements with local cable companies. Similarly, satellite carriers, upon request, are required to carry the signal of those television stations that request carriage and that are located in markets in which the satellite carrier chooses to retransmit at least one local station, and satellite carriers cannot carry a broadcast station without its consent. The Company has elected to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with cable operators and satellite carriers for both our network-affiliated stations and our independent stations.While the Commission is not actively proceeding with its rulemaking to reexamine the retransmission consent negotiation process and particularly the standards that may trigger the agency’s intervention to enforce the obligation of the parties to negotiate these agreements in “good faith,” the docket remains open. A related agency proceeding also remains open that looks toward the possible elimination of the “network nonduplication” and “syndicated exclusivity” rules that permit 9broadcasters to enforce certain contractual programming exclusivity rights through the FCC\\'s processes rather than by judicial proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or their possible impact on the Company.Other proceedings before the FCC and the courts have reexamined the policies that protect television stations\\' rights to control the distribution of their programming within their local service areas. For example, the FCC in 2014 has initiated a rulemaking proceeding on the degree to which an entity relying upon the Internet to deliver video programming should be subject to the regulations that apply to multi-channel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable operators and satellite systems. That proceeding raised a variety of issues, including whether some Internet-based distributors might be able to take advantage of MVPDs\\' statutory copyright licensing rights. We cannot predict the outcome of such proceedings that address the use of new technologies to challenge traditional means of redistributing television broadcast programming or their possible impact on the Company.The FCC may impose substantial penalties for violations of its rules and policies.  For example, settlement of an investigation involving a single radio station’s failure to broadcast proper sponsorship identification announcements in a series of ads required the licensee to make a payment of over $500,000. Uncertainty continues regarding the scope of the FCC\\'s authority to regulate indecent programming, but the agency has increased its enforcement efforts regarding other programming issues such as sponsorship identification, broadcasting proper emergency alerts, and extending service to persons with disabilities. We cannot predict the effect of the FCC’s expanded enforcement efforts on the Company.NATIONAL MEDIAOur National Media segment represents our collection of national and international businesses including Katz, Stitcher, Triton and Newsy. These businesses compete on emerging platforms and marketplaces where there is significant growth in both audience and revenue, such as over-the-top (OTT) and over-the-air (OTA) video and digital video. OTT refers to the delivery of content over the internet which can be assessed through apps on internet-connected devices such as set-top boxes (such as Roku or Apple TV), smartphones, smart TVs and tablets. OTA content can be viewed using antennas or through a cable subscription. Digital audio is on-demand, streaming music or spoken-word programming that can be subscription based or advertising supported. Our digital audio businesses serve consumers, publishers and advertisers by providing a suite of services including content production and distribution, technology, sales, and measurement.\\xa0KatzKatz operates four over-the-air networks — Bounce, Escape, Grit and Laff. The networks are primarily broadcast over-the-air on local broadcasters\\' digital sub-channels. They are also carried on some cable and satellite services. Each of the networks is a fast-growing, audience-targeted national broadcast network. Bounce is aimed at African-Americans; Grit airs western movies and series targeted to men; Escape runs scripted dramas and true crime docuseries targeting women; and Laff airs classic, well-loved comedies. Each of these Nielson rated networks reaches about 90 percent of all U.S. households as reported by Nielsen.  Katz has recently announced the relaunch of a fifth over-the-air network, Court TV. This network is devoted to live, gavel-to-gavel coverage, in-depth legal reporting and expert analysis of the nation’s most important and compelling trials. The network will launch in May 2019 and will be available for cable, satellite and over-the-air and over-the-top carriage. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The primary source of revenue for Katz is through the sale of advertising to national customers. The advertising revenue generated depends on viewership ratings and the rate paid by customers for certain viewer demographics. Katz sells its advertising in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. In the scatter market, advertisers buy their spots closer to the time when the spots will run. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time the upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.Due to increased demand in the spring and holiday seasons, the second and fourth quarters normally have higher advertising revenues than the first and third quarters.10Katz has carriage agreements with local television broadcasters and cable and satellite providers to carry one or more of the Katz networks. These carriage agreements are generally for a five-year term. Under these agreements, Katz pays a fixed fee for the carriage rights.For programming, Katz enters into agreements to license existing programming and movies, as well as to produce several original shows.StitcherStitcher creates original podcasts, operates the Stitcher and Earwolf networks, and provides podcast agency services that generate revenue for more than 300 shows. A podcast is a digital audio recording in spoken-word format, usually part of a themed series, which is downloaded or streamed most often to mobile devices. In 2018, it’s estimated that 73 million Americans listened to a podcast at least monthly. Stitcher also provides a mobile app listening platform where consumers can stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment on demand. We expect to make continued investments in our Stitcher app, with the objective of creating a best-in-class user experience for the podcast listener and advertiser.Stitcher earns revenue from the sale of advertising on its original podcasts, which it creates and distributes through platforms such as its Stitcher app and the iPhone podcast app. Other revenue sources include podcast agency services. Stitcher, through its Midroll Media advertising network, earns revenue by acting as a sales and marketing representative to connect advertisers and specific podcasts based on the advertiser\\'s desired target audience.Stitcher earns subscription revenue from the Stitcher Premium subscription service for which users pay a standard monthly or annual fee for access to premium content and ad-free archived podcast episodes.TritonOperating in more than 40 countries, Triton is the global leader in digital audio technology and measurement services, serving the growing digital audio marketplace. Triton provides innovative technology that enables broadcasters, podcasters and online music services to build their audience, maximize their revenue and streamline their operations. Triton’s technology is trusted by many of the biggest names in digital audio, including Pandora, Spotify, iHeart, Entercom, Cumulus, Prisa (Spain), Mediacorp (Singapore) and Karnaval (Turkey). Triton’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) business-to-business model has two main lines of business - measurement and infrastructure. Their primary source of revenue is the licensing of digital audio technology and services to a wide range of global audio publishers. Triton’s measurement technology platform is the standard in the digital audio marketplace, and its national and local metrics are the currency through which agencies and brands buy digital audio advertising from streaming audio companies across various geographies and devices. The national audience measurement product is offered for a fixed monthly fee with additional fees based on total audience listening hours. The local audience measurement product is offered on a fixed license fee for each market on which data is reported, along with annual fee escalations. Triton’s hosting and advertising infrastructure enables publishers around the world to deliver high-quality, digital audio streams with data-powered dynamic ad insertion to their listening audience. The hosting product is offered to users via a monthly license fee for access to the platform with additional fees for excess data delivery usage.

Through the advent of the world’s first programmatic audio advertising exchange, Triton provides the infrastructure in which publishers and advertisers can seamlessly transact audio inventory programmatically. NewsyNewsy is our national news network focused on bringing perspective and analysis to reporting on world and national news, including politics, entertainment, science and technology. It is targeted toward a younger audience. In 2017, we expanded Newsy\\'s distribution to include cable, and by the end of 2018, we reached agreements with cable and satellite operators to carry Newsy into approximately 36 million households. We expect continued investment in Newsy as we look to increase distribution and enhance our products.Newsy is also distributed widely on platforms providing over-the-top (OTT) television service, including Hulu, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Sling TV and Chromecast. 11Newsy earns revenue from the sale of advertising on the platforms on which it is distributed. It also receives carriage fees from cable providers who pay us to offer our programming to their customers. The revenue we receive is based on the number of subscribers who receive the programming.Newsy\\'s programming strategy is to provide in-depth coverage of U.S. and world news targeted at 25-34 year-olds. Newsy\\'s cable programming lineup includes fourteen hours of daily live news coverage consisting of shows such as the evening newsmagazine “The Why,” the morning show “The Day Ahead,” and the newsmaker spotlight program “30 Minutes With.” Newsy also produces investigative reports and documentaries.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031, 2018, we had approximately 3,950 full-time equivalent employees, of whom approximately 3,100 were with Local Media and 600 with National Media.
