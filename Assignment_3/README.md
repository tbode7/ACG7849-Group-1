## ACG7849-Group-1
### Target Information from SEC Filings: Business Description, Central Index Key, Company Name, Submission Type, Period of Report, and Length of Business Description

#### Group 1:
Tara Bode, Hankun Li, and Robert Bettaglio

 process many 10-K filings (annual reports) and isolate the business description section (item 1 of part I). Write each business description section (with HTML removed) to a new file in another folder (name the folder ‘item1’), and match the filename with the input filename (same filename, different folder) (so the business section of the filing  '279117.txt' read from the folder '10Ks' will be written as '279117.txt' in the folder 'item1').

Also write a separate output file with the filename,  CENTRAL INDEX KEY (there will be one CIK only), COMPANY CONFORMED NAME, CONFORMED SUBMISSION TYPE (mostly 10-K, but can be 10-KSB – SB is small business –, etc), CONFORMED PERIOD OF REPORT (end of fiscal year date) and the length (in characters) of the business section. (So this file will have one line for each 10-K.)
