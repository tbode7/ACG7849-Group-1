Coinbase reportedly launched the beta version of a prime product to develop institutional business. This could expand the company's pipelines. Meanwhile, these other companies could potentially create initial demand for their cannabis products through internal brands that capitalize on consumer and competitive industry trends. They could be more than cannabis cultivators. Know them here! This is a sponsored post. Check the disclaimer on the landing page. https://prem.li/BillionDollarLargestGreenLeafMarket

Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:$COIN) stock rises 1.5% in premarket trading as J.P Morgan analyst Kenneth Worthington initiates coverage of the company with an Overweight rating due to its key position in the growing space of transacting cryptocurrencies. I love this platform https://stockhaul.today/vrau3a ! I signed up three years ago and so glad I did with all of the innovations they are coming out with. It is really an important tool to use everyday for traders. I have found no better tool on the market and i have used a lot of them.

My 1 Year Price Target is $373.27 USD based on the following math;

Q1 earnings = 3.05 reported
Q2 earnings +40% = 4.27 Estimated
Q3 earnings +50% = 4.58 Estimated
Q4 earnings +60% = 4.88 Estimated
Total 2021 earnings Estimate = 16.77
Nasdaq PE ratio as of May 21, 2021 = 24.66
Estimated Forward PE of Nasdaq - 5% = 23.43
16.77 * 23.43 = 392.92
Dilution News -5% until Value Add is Announced = $373.27 USD

*My Estimations are based on Volume and User Growth Trends.

It's so funny that COIN the trading platform trades in concert with the price of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin down COIN down, Bitcoin up COIN up. So apparently many out there think it's some how related to the value of crypto when actually everyone of these trades up or down benefits COIN. I can't wait for the next earnings report. Adding on every big dip.

Ok real talk. We know Coinbase is gonna crush Q2 numbers already. Price will go up a lot on the way to earnings day. But... what do we do after? Unless we see a 60-70k Bitcoin price, analyst will be out to say ‚Äúohhh they‚Äôre not gonna be able to meet expectations in Q3‚Äù etc. And they‚Äôre probably right, earnings for Coin can be lumpy. I dare say it behaves like Bitcoin, where u‚Äôll see 20-30% gains a single quarter, and then a 10% drop in revenue the next, then maybe 50% up the next... etc.

Meanwhile, Brian Armstrong and team would need to make a lot of fast investments quickly, so that we make good use of that growing cash pile to be the Amazon of Crypto

Public companies do private placements, issuing shares to institutional investors at reasonable prices in order to fund the capital investment needed to spur a companies growth. On the other hand, do you know what inflation is? Imagining increasing the quantity of the dollar supply without any sort of accretive investment. THAT is dilution, and the proof is in the pudding (ie., inflation rate increase.) Get this: BTC isn't going up, USD is going down. USD isn't less "down" today than it was a week ago when BTC was 60k and rising. The price decrease was triggered by information attacks by centralized forces devoted to concealing the extent of the dollar's devaluation. Think news releases by short-dominated firms, but on a wider scale, employing tools like Elon Musk and even heads of agencies like the dept of commerce and IRS. Point is, the driving force behind BTC's increasing value is still strong (or, the devalued/diluted global reserve currency) and so miners like $BFARF (soon to be $BITF and to a lesser extent, $RIOT, $HUTMF, and $MARA) are criminally undervalued given that they producing Bitcoin at a fraction of it's retail value, and storing them. There will NEVER be ANY dilution of Bitcoin beyond the planned total supply following the final halving event. This is a genuinely scarce resource and a legitimate store of value backed by true energy input (and the associated value of energy used) along with the value assigned by those who use it as a hedge against the devaluation of their nation's currencies. There's no reason to neglect not only adding as many BTC to our portfolios as possible, but stocking on shares of miners as well.. BitFarms is the largest miner in North America and uplists to NASDAQ Global in a week or so... By the EOY, their all-in cost to produce one unit of Bitcoin will be ~2,700 and they mined more BTC last year than both $RIOT and $MARA. This is bigger than $COIN and 12x's more valuable than buying Bitcoin from an exchange. Why buy chips when you could own the casino? This is our time. Forget $TSLA and it's head puppet. Pack your bags and let's experience the reality of the wealth of the wicked being laid up for the righteous. The wealth transfer has only just begun; get some.

Loop Capital's Kourtney Gibson Says Coinbase Could Be Worth $400 To $450 Per Share
Mentioned:
COIN
Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) is a way to participate in the crypto space while hedging risk, Loop Capital's Kourtney Gibson said Thursday on CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report."
What Happened: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: $BTC) has fallen more than 50% from its all-time highs near $65,000 since April. The cryptocurrency sold off significantly on Wednesday before recovering quickly.
Although Coinbase is a user growth story, the platform is an exchange, Gibson said, adding that Coinbase is a beneficiary of volatility in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Gibson is seeing a lot of interest from institutional buyers, she said, also mentioning both asset owners and asset managers are balancing their portfolios with exposure to cryptocurrency.
The company is a leader in the cryptocurrency exchange space and the company will separate itself from the competition, she told CNBC.
Coinbase could be worth $400 to $450 per share, Gibson noted.

Coinbase brought in 770 million last quarter.Even if Coinbase were to only just bring in 750 million a quarter for the 4 quarters for 2021 that's 3 billion in earnings for 2021.Coin currently has a 51 billion dollar market capital.
In reality Coin is basically trading with a 17 times P/E Ratio for 2021 earnings.
And there are more newbies all around the world that are starting to trade Cryptocurrencies everyday now,especially since Coinbase's IPO or DPO.Even if Cojnbase were to cut transactions fees some traders would trade even more and by 2022 there will probably be 2 times more people trading on Coinbase than there are today.These are just hard facts.There is nothing left to debate.Coinbase is worth $400-$500 today.

Go Cathy!! She knows it‚Äôs On sale: Cathie Wood Cuts Apple Stake Almost Entirely ‚Äî And Buys More Coinbase

5/18/21, 1:20 AM
May 18, 2021 01:20 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Cryptocurrency

Cathie Wood-led Ark Investment Management on Monday shed nearly all of its stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and continued to snap up shares of Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN).

Ark sold 188,455 shares, worth about $23.8 million in Apple. After Monday's sale, the investment firm now holds a little under 3,000 shares in the Cupertino, California-based company via the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKF). No other Ark ETF has a position in Apple.

Shares of Apple closed 0.93% lower at $126.27 on Monday.

The New York-based investment firm snapped up another 259,897 shares, worth about $64.5 million, in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase via ARKF, the Ark Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK), and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSE:ARKW).

I need advise please. I mortgaged the hiuse and bought 1500 shares at 320.00 a share. No powder left and 30 percent on margin. How can I get out of this??
##############################
##############################
Tldr: Investors make their decisions based on their future expectations and given that the majority of crypto is built on short term hype, if crypto goes down, hype, future expectations and COIN stock goes down with it.

For those saying that COIN should be going up if crypto is going down because they make money from both sides of transactions, I would have to disagree. 90+% of the crypto market consists of hype from retail traders lured in with the hopes of quick profits. If crypto starts to reverse, in the short run, COIN will make more money, but that buzz starts to disappear and all COIN is left with, is the small audience of those that actively day trade crypto (gambling rather than trading) and the even smaller audience of enthusiasts that actually use crypto to buy stuff (just because they can, not because it is better or more convenient), which doesn‚Äôt look too good for investors future expectations, especially after China clamping down and Tesla (which has a lot of influence over the hype) dropping btc payments.

Look at search volume for Crypto terms and you‚Äôll notice the volume almost mirrors crypto prices. When Bitcoin goes down, so does interest and therefor transactions and therefor CON, I mean COIN.

I trade and swap and convert and I pay fee tether and dai are not coins you buy but a safe place to wait out drops in coins. I pay a fee to go in and out of them. The amount of the money I move either direction determines my fee. It‚Äôs usually 2%. This is just one example. COIN gets a grand a week just from me alone no matter what the coins are doing

The comments show many people moving from the denial phase to the anger phase with some engaging in "bargaining" by pretending big players will come and save COIN.

Another big leg down will get some capitulation with associated depression at huge loss and eventual acceptance. Only when the small fish investors have gone through the phases and gotten to depression or acceptance can COIN bottom.

If I see people move beyond anger and bargaining, it will indicated a bottoming process.
##############################
##############################
Coinbase makes money on the downside and upside, volatility is the greatest revenue driver for their business. The revenue they made on fees this weekend is most likely massive. Don't let these bears scare you into selling.
##############################
##############################
We're coming for you IPO day $400 peeps!
##############################
##############################
Everyone COIN is an exchange for retail and institutional investors. They don't care if the price of crypto's go up or down. The maniacal price movements are great for COIN (more buying and selling) hence more fees and trading revenue to the firm. Long for the long term. Goldman Sachs just came out with a 305.00 price target.
##############################
##############################
COIN is the best stock to buy. Only crypto trading platform listed. Crypto market is big and expanding fast. Over 200B USD crypto coins is traded every day. This company is making money and is getting bigger every day. 56 million verified users and over 7000 institutional users trading with them.
##############################
##############################
although the price of Bitcoin does play into the spread that coin base gets for a trade more important issue is volume. with the volatility over the past few days the volume has gone up dramatically and it's the volume that makes the revenue.
##############################
##############################
COIN is on its way to under $200 level. Just because ARKK buys it does not mean it‚Äôs time for you to buy. Cathie Wood is no guru when it comes to investing. Inflation and higher interest rates are imminent. These high beta stocks such as COIN are getting hammered and will continue to do so. Woods fund is down over 30% YTD. She had her glory now she will pay the price by her erratic investing in these high flying over priced securities
##############################

Gamma squezee ?

##############################
Faryar can't do anything, but upgrade from GS. Which they did.
##############################
##############################
I find it slightly comical that the COIN trading desk stock is dropping with the Bitcoin value. If anything the COIN stock itself will increase as volatility increases. The more trades the more money COIN makes. This should be interesting.

Coinbase wins Outperform rating at Piper on prime position in growing sector
May 14, 2021 8:18 AM ETCoinbase Global, Inc. (COIN)By: Liz Kiesche, SA News Editor1 Comment
Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto starts coverage of Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) with an Outperform as he expects the company to build on its strong growth trajectory given its "trusted brand name and commanding position in the evolving cryptoeconomy."
Sees ability to grow organically and through new product offerings supporting additional crypto assets.
And sees positive industry trends supporting growth.
"In our view, COIN is the most scaled play in the crypto space, an asset class that has the potential, in our view, to reshape financial services and the technology underpinning it," Repetto writes in a note to clients.
COIN shares gain 3.9% in premarket trading in the wake of its first earnings report since its direct listing last month, rebounding from an initial decline in Thursday's after-hours trading.
Repetto's Outperform rating aligns with the average Wall Street rating of Bullish (6 Very Bullish, 3 Neutral).
##############################
##############################
When NASDAQ RED tomorrow, coin will be in deep RED.
##############################
##############################
I got into this action like many others. Coinbase does not take such a large share in the portfolio, but it is not pleasant to see -30% :( There is a fear of a further fall, but now investors are in panic when Bitcoin is correcting (while it is a correction). The income of this crypto exchange for this year may to be colossal up to 5-10 billion, the higher the volatility, the better, besides, the exchange is quite popular. I believe that a return to 400 is quite possible. I will not sell shares yet and I do not advise you
##############################
##############################
Finally bought into COIN. Wall Street has bullish calls.
##############################
##############################
Before I buy COIN I‚Äôd rather buy CME

2021 3,000,000,000 in earnings with a 45 billion dollar market capital gives COINBASE a 15 P/E Ratio.
2,000,000,000 billion in earnings give COINBASE a 22.5 P/E Ratio.
Either way COINBASE is undervalued at Friday's closing price.
Play with the numbers all you want.

I bet Elon Musk got his hands on a bunch of cheap shares today. This is how the rich gets richer, at the expense of the average investors. Look at the financials filed with the SEC. A company that rakes in $1.8B in revenue with net income of $771M in one quarter is definitely doing well. Many companies in business longer than 50 years never get to see annual revenue of $1B, much less one quarter!

I mean you HAD to know we were in a bubble when every single "alt coin" had a run-up of like 5000% over the past three months. Maybe they'll have another little pump up but looks like the bubble has burst for now. But I'm sure there will be a lot of people trying to pick the bottom during the declines. That equals lots of trading fees for coinbase.

Coinbase made just about as much money in one quarter than Tesla has made its entire existence LMAO. If you go on Wolfram Alpha and plug in Coinbase's website, you'll see it has even more hits after April. That coupled with Dogecoin coming and Q2 as they already said, will be AT LEAST just as much or more than Q1. HINT: it'll be more. I've used this website to ACCURATELY predict many companies' earnings. The pandemic has turned many into day traders. No one cares about fees when all they want is 1,000%+ returns LOL.

1.)Those worried about competition have to know that COIN marketshare in global bitcoin business is only 11% so the remaining 89% will the easy target for competition.

2) COIN is not an exchange only but exchange and technology company which makes a much bigger difference.

3) COIN will add more cryptos in the near future starting by Dogecoin, so these are additional revenue streams.

4) Financial modeling using DCF or multiples suggest that COIN is fairly valued in the $260s minimum.

5) COIN price is correlated to volume of cryptos traded not the price of cryptos.

6)Selling or buying should be based on facts not unsupported spreading of fears or optimism.
##############################
##############################
Last quarter COIN posted $3 in earnings. Next quarter the expectation is $2 and most likely the next two quarters $2 each. That is $9 per year. At $224 (the actual price) forward PE is 224/9 about 25.
Add the RSI that is under 30 and $234 is a great price today.

Let's put it this way. Cryptos are here to stay. Coinbase is the EASIEST to use by far. Other companies make it as hard as possible to transfer assets or pay to do trades, and their interfaces are complex as hell. All Coinbase needs to do is add more coin types, and they'll rocket. The ONLY reason people use other companies is because Coinbase doesn't have a lot of offerings.

I think the bulls are correct that COIN‚Äôs next earnings may have blow out revenues with this recent crypto sell off. On the contrary, with recent current events and the sell off, the crypto market cap is being drained and people aren‚Äôt purchasing more, so COIN future earnings looks bleak.

Next price prediction for coin puzzles??
250 or 150?
##############################
##############################
"Coinbase quarter to date performance across our four key business metrics are trending to meet or exceed our first quarter results," the company said in a shareholder letter. Trading volume is likely to meet or exceed first quarter levels if it continues at the current pace, the company said.

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that the company planned to add Dogecoin to its platform in the next six to eight weeks.

Binance is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice.

So let's see...COIN is making tons of money, and the amount they are making is continuing to increase. Cyrpto is extremely volatile, so it swings up and down with a large volume. Every time someone sells or buys crypto COIN makes money. DOGE is coming soon (along with other coins). COIN customers make automatic reoccurring investments, and enjoy the benefit of staking. Their biggest competitor Binance, will have to pay enormous fines, and is now suffering irreversible reputational damage for money laundering and breaking tax laws. How can this stock NOT go up from here?

Hope you kids know you are playing in thin air with your imaginations. Coin base is a thought,
and not like stocks with a product or service that people use. Crypto is play money that does
not exist. It could work, but it could drop to 0 too. Hate to see people lose money that they need
to live on. So use money that you won't miss if you lose it all.

Party is over! without crypto to trade what function will this company have? None! The day of reckoning has arrived. You guys can talk about how the volatility is great for Coin but now its much more than mere volatility, people are realizing its all a Ponzi scheme and once all the selling is done then this company no longer has a business. People were going along not because they understood it but because they just figured that even though there was no logic to it they were still missing out on the potential for great profits. However, somebody pulled the fire alarm and everybody is heading for the doors. This will be ugly tomorrow starting at 4am, most not being able to trade till 7, 8 or 9 am. I have to admit that greed also got the better of me and ignoring all the alarms going off in my head I too became a victim. However I know that walking away with something is better than walking away with nothing. I already said goodbye to my crypto investment losses, you got to know when to let go (this applies to many scenarios in life including investments). Less money and peace of mind is more important to me. Sorry to those who got financially ruined by this scam. Perhaps you can recover some of your money from people like Elon Musk. BTW, the move to allow the listing of Doge was a huge mistake, it served to further take credibility away from crypto and Coinbase.

May 24 (Reuters) - Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) has appointed Faryar Shirzad, a former White House official, as chief policy officer, the cryptocurrency exchange said in a blog post on Monday.

Shirzad joins the company against the backdrop of increased regulatory scrutiny around digital currencies globally.

He served as deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs at the White House and was most recently the global co-head of government affairs at Goldman Sachs (GS), where his tenure spanned 15 years.

Previously, he was also the assistant secretary for import administration at the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Coinbase, which went public earlier this year, in March named Brett Redfearn, a former director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, as vice president of capital markets division.

##############################
This thing makes money regardless of the price of BTC or any crypto. Volatility actually means HIGHER revenues for this and other exchanges. If you think crypto is completely dead that's one thing... but if you think crypto is huge and going no where...COIN will print money. Think for yourself.

In a note initiating coverage of Coinbase with a Buy rating on Tuesday, Oppenheimer‚Äôs Owen Lau wrote that the ‚Äúfee compression concern is overblown.‚Äù He thinks that Coinbase‚Äôs business model isn‚Äôt the same as a traditional exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate.

Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. Handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost. The company is also building out a ‚Äúsuite of services‚Äù that have recurring revenue, including a program called ‚Äústaking‚Äù that allows crypto holders to earn interest.

Lau values Coinbase at 16 times its 2022 revenue expectations, coming to a $434 price target. He has a rating of Outperform on the stock.

BTIG analyst Mark Palmer also wrote a bullish note on Coinbase, seeking to dispel the fee-compression argument. Palmer thinks the bears may currently be winning the argument about Coinbase because the company used a nontraditional path to sell its shares, listing them directly on the Nasdaq instead of working with a bank to market and sell them. He thinks the path of Coinbase‚Äôs stock may resemble that of Facebook ‚Äòs. Facebook (FB) initially fell after its initial public offering, but recovered as investors grew more comfortable with its business model.

Palmer‚Äôs price target is $500, based on a multiple of 16 times the company‚Äôs projected 2024 sales.

Why Goldman Sachs Considers Coinbase A Good Way To Enter The Cryptocurrency Eco-System

5/24/21, 12:16 PM
May 24, 2021 12:10 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst Color

Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ:COIN) has both strong customer acquisition and a rapidly growing institutional clients, while the ecosystem has grown significantly with the rising adoption of digital currencies, according to Goldman Sachs.

The Coinbase Global Analyst: Will Nance initiated coverage of Coinbase Global with a Buy rating and a price target of $306.

The Coinbase Global Thesis: The company has an ‚Äúattractive business model that thrives on elevated cryptocurrency volatility‚Äù and faces opportunities to add new features and capabilities, Nance said in the initiation note.

Coinbase Global offers ‚Äúa blue-chip way‚Äù to invest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, he added.

‚ÄúWhile we believe the core business today offers an attractive growth profile with the potential to drive high levels of profitability, we see significant white space for new initiatives to drive more stable and recurring revenue streams to complement the core trading business over the longer term,‚Äù the analyst wrote.
SHORTIES...soon to be painful!!!

##############################
##############################
As a crypto enthusiast as well as a very unsatisfied Coinbase Pro user who has unresolved customer service issues....I was hopeful that by now they would actually have human beings taking calls after a few attempts with their "automated" system. I also believe that the legitamacy of crypto as a whole, will be looked at with Gary Ginsler at the helm of the SEC. I do not argue for over regulation but with coins such as Doge, having a mkt cap greater than the majority of companies included in the S&P 500 index...a coin with billions of coins floating around...a coin that has...maybe 1 or 2 developers working to make it actually usable...and recently coinbase announcing they will have Doge on its exchange in a few months...what does that tell me? It tells me that 80-90% of the hype in Crypto is no longer Bitcoin. Thousands of coins are now on the mkt & Bitcoin's dominance has dropped from 60% to approx. 40%, which is partially due to the increase in value of Ethereum but also because of vapor coins such as Doge being hyped by the likes of Elon Musk, Mark Cuban. As both a trader as well as investor in both tradition as well as crypto mkts...to read all the anticipatory hype around Doge as time drew near to 4/20....the weed holiday...than Elon's appearance on Saturday night live...calling it a "hustle"....than later stating he wouldnt allow Tesla purchases with Bitcoin but he was having some of his developers work with Doge....
Coinbase is going after revenue at all costs. Maybe in the short term they'll succeed by continuing to add coins whose value is dictated by one or two peoples "tweets"...but if I was Brian Armstrong I would go on record stating that the hype surrounding this element of the crypto world is going to bring more regulatory scutinany and a de-legitamization of crypto as a whole. Coinbase does do alot of institutional trading of BTC & ETH but a very small % of BTC volume at retail.
I for one would love to see more regulatory scrutiny over this modern day pump & dump, insider trading like occurances when there is huge volume moves in a coin, than two days later a PR. While I believe Elon Musk to be our generations greatest minds, if he wasn't aware of the damage BTC mining was and has done to the environment...with China mining the vast majproty...in areas where coal is the primary energy source...to come out last week & change course...as though he, as "the planet savior"... didn't know when he announced Tesla bought 1.5 Billion of BTC.
If Coinbase is going to survive long term, it cannot because of hype created and the subsequent trading volumes when someone like Elon Musk....or the very shady...Michael Saylor...makes announcements that can either create pumps or dumps.
If all this doesn't bother you...the serious investor...if you think hype is a good driver or a company's sucess....I guess I've gotten old and besides being a gambler...i only gamble on people, and companies, industries I trust.
That's just me...
Good Luck

Just look at all current analyst forecasts....they‚Äôre all thinking Coinbase will be doing worst Q2 onwards and Q1 is a flash in the pan, but they‚Äôre wrong based on the earnings call..some of the key points:

1) Coinbase do not provide guidance, but Q2 are shaping up to be as good or even better than Q1 based on the transaction volumes that they‚Äôve seen so far

2) Doge will be listed by end of Q2. With its market capitalization and active transactions, we can see this contributing at least another 15% increase to Coinbase‚Äôs total transactions

And I‚Äôm just assuming we will not see immediate contributions from all the collaborations they have with institutional customers in 2021..

Price does not always equal value.

If you look at metrics like exchange volume where most of the money is made it has been on a steady up trend.

BTC has always been volatile, the price swings will be dramatic but if that volume keeps increasing the exchange is laughing all way to the bank.

They are going to blow that 3.05 first quarter earnings out of the water.

I'll buy at $50

I posted this - and yes I got 14 thumbs down & 1 up, it was 298 then. (John 28days ago - $COIN conversation
I will buy from 100-120 if reality happens in the next three months.)
Now I may wait for something from 50 - 60$ ? Then try to think sober minded about making a profit and sleep well.

Biggest Scam IPO ever seen dropped half Value since first day Imao

It can go straight down to $50 and $60 range within a week.

Are people not intelligent or something? Riot and Mara are up, why short? Going against the wind?

Notice btc is down, but the miners are up? De correlation between stock and btc is a strong indicator that this market is oversold.

Please us govt provide more regulation guidance. Coin a clear winner in this situation due to first movers advantage.

Interesting to note that 70% of revenue is from fees, and that competition will drive that revenue segment down.

However, with the rise of crypto in the coming months, there are quick profits to reap.

These are the same words that are echoed by Oppenheimer, mizuho, ark, ...

Listen to new constructs if you want... I checked the credential of these guys... I would never hire these folks compared to the ones from opp and ark.

In at $289. Attractive forward PE is why I bought.

I give Coinbase a BUY Rating
My 1 Year Price Target is $373.27 USD based on the following math;

Q1 earnings = 3.05 reported
Q2 earnings +40% = 4.27 Estimated
Q3 earnings +50% = 4.58 Estimated
Q4 earnings +60% = 4.88 Estimated
Total 2021 earnings Estimate = 16.77
Nasdaq PE ratio as of May 21, 2021 = 24.66
Estimated Forward PE of Nasdaq - 5% = 23.43
16.77 * 23.43 = 392.92
Dilution News -5% until Value Add is Announced = $373.27 USD

*My Estimations are based on Volume and User Growth Trends.

This is his wake up call.

If this would be valued on par with the NDAQ which is still arguably overvalued this would still have at least 50% more down to go.
##############################
##############################
Coinbase makes it's money from transaction fees, OK I get it. But the people will flow to wherever the fees are lower and COIN's are high. Also the gov'ts all over the world are stepping in to look at crypto for various reasons including possible fraud transactions, money laundering, et. etc. etc. Be very careful here folks unless you are just a trader playing daily.

Facts:
5 days ago the entire crypto market cap was $2.35 trillion. As of this post the market cap is $1.733 Trillion or a decrease of over $600 Billion USD. This equates to over a 26% decline. For those who try to sell the idea that volatility is great for Coinbase, can you explain to me how $600 Billion less in value is going to add trading revenue volumes? Consider that many who have jumped into crypto did so after the run up after the COVID selloff. Many in this group bought when Bitcoin was supposed to hit 75K....than saw it decline and trade sideways...55Kish...Than the whole NFT hype, Coinbase IPO....how many of these people have to stomach or nerves to watch they're balances get pummeled...especially after the selloff that began after a China related anti crypto story traveled across every media venue...than sold off more so when BTC crossed 40K...all the way down to 3OK. I wish you luck as I too am pro crypto...but as a Coinbase Pro customer, very much anti Brian Armstrong & Company. So forget about the "newbies" who got burned and won't come back for a long time...how much money do you think Coinbase makes when their website & App crash, making it impossible to buy the dip...or cut your losses to get out? Try to resolve anything with they're non existent customer service department...as you know...you should know about a company before you invest...so do yourself a favor a "Google" Coinbase Customer service complaints. Than recently Coinbase announced(because of all the talk about competition and lower trade fees/and the need for additional sources of revenue) they announce they are creating a " Media Arm"...Well if your a customer and you've ever attempted to resolve an issue...your probably thinking they should create a "Customer Service Arm"....and as an investor...on the day of greatest volatility...your company cannot exploit this in the form of trading fees because your site is down for hours...

On top of that the announcement that Coinbase is going to add Doge to its exchange...If your a serious crypto enthusiast and investor rolled up into one, like I am...Id see this as desperation...maybe a trading volume market share decision...but how can Coinbase be taken seriously anymore? If you've ever jumped into crypto with the Coinbase App...you know that some of the coins...none recently...have tutorials to explain how the particular Cryptocurrency was developed, what it's functions will be, the problems it will solve. In exchange for watching short videos you are rewarded $2.00 rewards...some cryptos with 3 or 4 videos. I thought that was pretty awesome as I didn't know much about particular coins besides BTC, ETH, LTC. I wonder when Doge is added that coin will have "reward tutorials". Question # 1(your asked questions after you view a video).
Why was Dogecoin Created?
A-A DeFi platform
B-A stable coin
C-An "Oracle" developer
D-A Joke

And Coinbase is an SEC regulated company whose CEO bailed on a huge percentage of his shares on IPO day... many for over $400/share....

the company has next to zero customer service unless your an institution...

and now they are going to be in the market of selling jokes...

Imagine for a minute if the Nasdaq, or a company such as Etrade or TD Ameritrade crashed for several hours...costing investors millions upon millions of dollars. The next day you'd see big time Wall Street Law firms announcing class action suits against the exchanges. Put yourself in the shoes of thousands of people who wanted to either get out or buy as the market tanked. This isn't the first time. and is it too hard to believe that Coinbase intentionally shuts down because they do not have the funds to cover massive amounts of redemptions????
##############################

inflatable stock due to crypto hype I am currently holding will let go by early next year as this short squeeze is bearish at most and coinbase technology and the years they have put in in making their platform is sort of a long term thing aka aapl microsoft in early 80s and there is a long terms goals as crypto blockchain tech takes over certain types of transactions from financial institutions so mark my word in 2030 this stock will cross the usd 13000 and will be NASDAQ for crypto

Points about Coinbase.
1. The current Mcap is cheap if the revenue continues to grow. The price action suggest that the growth is not guaranteed. Or that Q1 is an outlier.
2. Coinbase is not in the business of performing "btc to btc" transactions. Big moves between whales and mining Companies do NOT have to go through Coinbase or any exchange.
3. Coinbase executes "fiat to crypto, or crypto to fiat". Coibase is holding large amounts of crypto as a buffer and a large part of the Coinbase fee goes to internal risk management and paying the transaction of btc. This is different from a stock exchange or a traditional bank. Anyone with a crypto wallet and some cash management can open a "crypto exchange". It will probably not be legal and limited in size but the barrier to entry is basically zero. I.e. The value of this stock is in the good name and the customer base. Tech wise, this money management could be replicated by any and all large US banks.

##############################
Inflation will correct the whole market by 10-15%, especially Tech stocks, not the end of the world but it will cool a lot the frenzy of buyers who have no idea what they are buying.

Hey kids. After a month of warning you and begging you to think about why you buy a stock that always goes down I said yesterday "Stay Tuned".

Some Positive Quotes from articles...

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at the long-term and so these blips, they don‚Äôt faze us,‚Äù Emilie Choi, president and chief operating officer of crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc., said last week on Bloomberg TV about the wild swings prevalent in the market. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking for the long-term opportunity and you kind of buckle up and go for it.‚Äù

"But, ‚Äúfor many crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the long-term story has not changed,‚Äù said Simon Peters, an analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro. ‚ÄúThis emerging asset class continues to revolutionize many aspects of financial services, and while nothing goes up in a straight line, the long-term fundamentals for crypto assets remain as solid as ever.‚Äù

Coinbase pro has higher exchange trading volumes in Q2 that it had across Q1. (See nomics). So earning in Q2 can be expected to beat the record Q1 earnings.

So why is this stock tanking? Hedgies out to shake loose all those papers hands. If you seel/sold look to buy back in before Q2 earning pops.

##############################
An analyst again ask about digital wallets and new players offering crypto offerings. Does Coinbase see them as a competitor or partner.

Brian Armstrong answered: there‚Äôs a lot of effort needed to build the infrastructure. Many are reaching out to Coinbase to work with them. Coinbase is looking to productise more of their services/ offerings to work with these companies.

So they offer a private share offerings that can be executed at a future price and with the price targets in the mid 400‚Äôs, that could be very very good. Borrowed money now will be paid back with a higher price in the future.

This means the company views their share price to be low enough to place a wager it will be higher in future and will not have to pay out of pocket to cover the gap..well that seems Positive

Here's a thought on the future of COIN and crypto. When AMZN went from books to e-commerce what were the initial sentiments by the market and investors, and then GOOG post Yahoo/AOL at its 2004/05 IPO, for AAPL and the new IPhone in 2007, Then NFLX when it went from DVD's to streaming, then FB and social media and its IPO in 2013, then TSLA and the EV, and now COIN and the move into a digital currency and/or collectible, etc.? I say rinse n' repeat as there will always be that next new and unproven concept vs prospective investor/market sentiment-challenged company/industry that comes along every 5-10 years or so. You have to ask yourself what does an actual bank look like in 5-10 years from now and how do people buy things and pay their bills, invest, and so on to that of the more recent smart phone/AAPL pay via a simple physical device/logical software-based swipe = transaction complete! #COIN > first in line, grow the brand, do it better than anyone else = build that investor base and attract the big money funds, banks, etc....

It‚Äôs inevitable that crypto currency will be the way of the future. The government will centralize it a bit and voila. It amazes me how many people are not forward-thinking. Coinbase will be a household name real soon. Hold for $1000/share in 3-5 years.
##############################
##############################
I have an account with them and been buying many coins and blockchains across the board. Right now there is a rotation going on in the coin market. One example, I bought MATIC a week ago, and already up 182%. Coinbase will make money as long as this rotation keeps happening and as it does trading will become more intense. I have no idea if COIN is worth the price but I will watch it closely and become a buyer of the stock down the road.

@Jeniffer COIN will be a great company. But in this market COIN is overvalued. COIN's current revenue is 1 billion and market cap is 50 billion. So prices to Sales ratio is 50 which is huge.
##############################

bought at 315 on 4-20 went down since, just bought this morning at 267 lets see if it drops for another month. I do have a stragety with this. 1 share at a time until it goes under 100 then maybe bigger lots.
##############################
##############################
Coinbase is trading at about 7-8 times 2021 sales.CHEAP AS DIRT IN TODAY'S MARKET. 1.8 BILLION TIMES 4 QUARTERS is 7.2 billion in revenues for 2021 and Coin only has a 52 billion dollar market capital valuation.
And that would be with no growth.
Let's say Coin brings in 6 billion in revenues for 2021.We would still be trading at only 8-9 times sales.

Whales are dumping and lets see how all these under-funded exchanges can keep up with fake trades to show liquidity.

When whales are selling, they are not coming back so you will be holding a bag of worthless digital numbers.

Prosecutors should monitor/audit the recent pull back and ask the exchanges for trading activities on 'who is the buyer for all these sell orders'? I know who they are and they don't last long since their commission is less than the loss due to price decrease.

Good luck $COIN - you have been milking it too long to steal small traders' money destroying people's life savings.

Dear longs, you may have noticed something different today.... in the various boards and forums that I visit to read about Coin, there‚Äôs more and more people acknowledging that Coin will benefit from the volatility of crypto, and they will crush their earnings. There‚Äôre more people stepping up to answer and defend against the FUD and fear mongering among the trolls. This to me signals a turning point to the stock. While there‚Äôs still some dependency on Crypto‚Äôs price of the day, as more and more investors start to understand Coin‚Äôs business model, we will see reduced correlation between the share price and Bitcoin‚Äôs price

It's funny how dump money lost money on $GME and then $TSLA and then $DOGE.
I even know who lost over $200k on all three and still holding until he loses everything.
Just sad.

Think about all these crytos - the founders were busy dumping their initial coins that they rarely develop their actual technology/platforms. Actually, there is no sales/revenue/service provided ever.

In real world, companies raise money in stock and use the money to complete their products/services. Once revenue/profit is generated, the company starts paying out dividends forever.

What about all these coins? Nothing and all these coin trading activities are done by fake trades from bots to inflate transactions/liquidities. Proof? Look at the trade vols, spreads, size of blocks - nothing matches and several exchanges went burst (due to lack of capital when they are milking it with commissions?)

Soon, regulators will audit the exchanges and criminal activities will be prosecuted.

Think about one thing - who is the market maker for coins? and who has capital to provide liquidity?
How come the trading vol is about 10x - 15x greater than actual?

IMO, $COIN needs to be audited asap along with other counterparties who create all these transactions.

The more crypto is gaining attention, the more it attracts and educates investors, businesses etc. about it as a new asset class. Thus, it will become more integrated/adapted and legitimized over time.

COIN is not Bitcoin lol. They make money on transactions to buy or sell it but the value of Bitcoin has no direct impact on the value of this stock. People on this board are not too sharp.
##############################
##############################
Is it just me? The Coinbase IPO was one of the most hyped in recent history along with ABNB. If you've ever used Air B&B & you have issues, you call the company, as its staffed with highly trained support staff. If you've ever used Coinbase or CB Pro & had an issue, you look around their website & there is not a phone number on the entire site. Sadly, when you send them an email you get a "bot" reply, often times directing you to an irrelevant part of their website. Than you contact them again, you get " due to unexpected demand"(or words to that effect) we will get back to you in 3-5 days. When your issue involves "serious" money & your unable to even attach a file that references trade mistakes...I actually was hopeful that with IPO proceeds Brian Armstrong would direct his Customer Service VP to add phone support, measurable increases in "customer satisfaction" etc...Maybe it's too soon to expect that?

Now they need 1.5 Billion more...not long after they're IPO????

Anyone know where that will be spent?

To add attorneys more than likely as if they're seriously considering adding Doge to their exchange that is basically a pump & dump coin without a company behind it....how can any serious investor think Coinbase is legit if it's revenue stream will be dependant on transaction fees involving such low quality crypto's that are now the Twitter rage but will dissapear once regulators begin to scrutinize, not merely the individuals who pump coins after they share that info with big dollar traders, but the very exchanges, in this case Coinbase that is a regulated security.

You'd think with the recent quarterly report that showed such a massive increase in revenue & profit, the company wouldnt need to deflate the value of their shares by adding debt...but maybe Brian Armstrong needs a bigger salary...which is kinda counter intuitive as he sold tens of millions in his shares the first day of trading.

These 30-40% drops in Crypto are necessary when you make 200-1000% moves per annum. Shake off the paper hands and reward the diamond hands. Longs will be rewarded.

Algos are just trying to break the IPO price. This is all computer driven. I hope it goes lower so I can buy more. The more volatility and interest in Crypto, the better for COIN

Brilliant! The slaughtering of Cathie's meme stocks continues!

##############################
Doesn‚Äôt coinbase also incur revenue when their users sell crypto? So are these drops being directly correlated with crypto justified if they are still earning commissions on sells?
##############################
##############################
No offense‚Ä¶but when I want to get a good laugh I go check on COIN‚Äôs share price, and then if I want more of a chuckle I check this thread.

This decline has nothing to do with the stock itself, BTC is on a dip and the NAS is deep red. Still highly undervalued. We should recoup most if not all 4% today.
##############################
##############################
It‚Äôs going to be brutal downfall next 2 weeks with new offerings ... bulls save and exit with 10 percent loss than 90 percent loss ... choice is yours

So is COIN headed to $10 or $100?

##############################
When this stock is worth 50$ then I‚Äôll consider it a value play.

Coin to 1000 by year end. They are in talk to buy out Robinhood

Ha ha ha who bought at 429?

The amazing thing is all analyst forecasting a worst Q2 compared to Q1. Based on existing data to daily transaction volumes at Coinbase, everything is pointing to a massive beat in Q2!

Seriously what‚Äôs fair price in short term? 275-300

Bitcoin Up-Coinbase down/ Bitcoin down-Coinbase down/High volatility-Coinbase down. As we discussed before the share will go higher only after Armstrong and his friends buy again at half price the shares that sold on the first trading days...

Can someone explain clearly why Musk who has basically zero knowledge of crypto ( he‚Äôs smart but not in currency) controls the ups and downs?
Don‚Äôt forget this is the guy who thinks Buffet and Munger don‚Äôt understand the future.

The short numbers are out. 18% of Friday‚Äôs transactions, or 2.155 million shares were shorted. Data from Fintel‚Äôs site. Sigh, no surprise there seeing the weird price action.

A bright future for this company with this strong ceo

Coin & SI do the same thing. Coin went public without wall street, seems like for that they will not support, no matter what.......boy club...
##############################
##############################
Very conservative $11 earnings in 2021, 30 multiple, $330.....40 multiple, easy $440. It will be volatile with Crypto prices but this stock is a keeper for the next 3 years.
##############################
##############################
Nice strong close, they failed to run it down lower into it. Bought the COIN dip & Crypto Dip.
##############################
##############################
The Coinbase makes more money with volitilty argument:
That's true when the market goes up as it did since March of last year...but as the entire crypto Mkt Cap is down 1Trillion USD since it peaked at 2.5Trillion...The average coinbase user is getting wiped out meaning less and less money to play with. I'm honestly surprised that people even argue about it. Add into the equation that intelligent invrstors/traders get out 0f the riskiest asset class first...and an asset class that losses 40% of its value...fast is the riskiest asset & personally cannot wait for the dat when dogecoin, shubuwhatever and the other 2,000cryptos that don't even have more than 1 or 2 employees to crash as they de-legitamize an industry I believe in.

The volume in Bitcoin only serves to increase the profitability in COIN.
##############################
##############################
People fail to understand that volatility in crypto increases revenues for crypto exchanges. BTC may go down till 30K before doing the next parabolic run. People hating on Cathy has no idea about what they're talking about.. Due to inflation fears and eventual interest rate hikes, tech stocks like Apple will likely selloff. BTC on the other hand is seen as an inflation hedge.. so Coin will likely rise alongside BTC.

Here we go again ?
I just can‚Äôt help myself.

Coinbase traded vol of 19 billion dollars today so far. Q1 had a combined 385 billion with FCF of 780 million. If the volatility continues they could do 1 trillion+ in trades in q2. That would be fcf around 2.2-2.6 billion. Valuation 140 billion, near 300% increase current price.
