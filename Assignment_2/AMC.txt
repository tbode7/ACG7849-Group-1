Super Breakdown of outstanding shares and the fact that nothing makes sense.

450 million share vs 490 million float

7.16% % of Shares Held by All Insider 32,220,000 32,220,000
25.85% % of Shares Held by Institutions 116,325,000 127,440,500
-----------------------
148,545,000 159,660,500

450,000,000 493,000,000
148,545,000 159,660,500
------------------ ------------------
301,455,000 333.439,500

So at 450 million shares before the 43 million AMC selloff the most real shares retail can own is 301,455,000. Well with the alleged 3.2 million shareholders in the US and Canada alone, that averages roughly 100 shares per holder. Factor into the equation global holders and the number of shares per holder drops tremendously probably closer to an average of 70 to 80. Impossible.

At 493 million shares after the dilution so to speak, if percentages stayed the same or similar, the most shares available for retail is 333.439,500. Now lets say as an example the AMC investor base grew only 200K since Aron's announcement. That would be 3.4 million in US and Canada, So again roughly only 98 shares per shareholder, excluding global retail investors.

Through various polling we all know that many many retail investors own over 5000 shares. We know even more own over 1000 shares, we know even a larger amount own over 500 shares, and we know even a greater amount own over 100 shares, the smallest pool of investors I would bet lies at the under 100 share base. so lets break this down.

5% own 5000 or more - 170,000 shareholders holding roughly 850,000,000 shares
10% own 1000 or more - 340,000 shareholders holding roughly 170,000,000 shares
35% own 500 or more - that equals 1,190,000 shareholders holding roughly 595,000,000 shares
40% own 100 or more shares - 1,360,000 shareholders holding roughly 116,000,000 shares
10% own 99 or less shares - 340,000 shareholders owning roughly 33,660,000 shares.

Just on this basic average which I dont this is outlandish from a percentage breakdown you get a total of 1,764,660,000 shares owned by retail investors. And on top of that, this only includes retail investors in the US and Canada. Can you imagine how many synthetic shares could be truly floating around out there if these numbers are anywhere near accurate? This float might have to churn as much a 6 times to fix this mess. It is impossible to even begin to estimate overseas shares. but I would assume over 2 billion shares of AMC do exist and that does not even include institutions and insider shares.

It was said that AMC Entertainment Holdings had ended with a hair over $1 billion in available liquidity, which marked its greatest level in company history. This might expand the range of exciting possibilities! Furthermore, these other companies could reach approximately $73 billion in 2020. This could be the place to go for information!

Wow ! Hit piece after hit piece on AMC. This company has never had this much attention in it's history.

In fact, AMC is getting as much or more attention than many huge companies right now.

Most of the articles are warning investors away from AMC as if they are about to go bankrupt (AMC is already fully funded thru the end of 2022).

The writers, many of which work for Motley Stool, also act like they care about our investments ? This is new......when have they ever cared how much money 💰 they were actively stealing from us?

So, if we ponder the reason why AMC is the 'talk of the town' right now, it should be obvious. WE POSE A THREAT TO THEM !!

We are using social media to band together and we're holding what they so desperately need...... our shares. The big hedge funds have been creating synthetic shares out of thin air over the last year. They need the real shares, but the problem is - WE OWN THE FLOAT - WE HAVE THE SHARES !!

The big hedge funds lost roughly one $Billion$ over the last week.... this is not sustainable. Every day that passes pushes the Hedge Funds closer to the edge of the cliff !

A SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT !

Do Not Sell Your Shares !

BUY & HODL ! This rocket 🚀 is fueled and ready for lift-off !

APES FOR LIFE !!

Not only are shorts losing money every day but huge hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars due to retail investors holding.
This is a huge win for retail investors – our favorite companies have been saved.
Unless shorts close their positions, hedge funds will continue to suffer.
Interest rates will continue to skyrocket for short sellers, enabling them to close their positions sooner than later
An AMC short squeeze might be closer than we think.
Here’s what retail investors can do:
Continue to hold your positions, it’s free!
Buy the dips to counter any short attacks.
Share articles on social platforms that can provide value to the community and keep everyone informed.
Keep a close eye on the stocks performance so you do not miss the squeeze.
Hedge funds are not going to be able to recover from this. Yes they can possible receive help from huge banks but this too will be at a cost.

Furthermore, borrowing money from banks won’t change the fact that shorts still have to cover their positions. Retail investors are buying AMC stock every day. Shorts are fighting a war they cannot win.

Important advisory: I am not a licensed financial advisory. I simply have a passion for finance and writing.

TODAY'S THING TO KNOW- just a learning lesson. GO LONG! So, many have bailed out, some at under ten dollars, most around there. That is fine, but bottom line, they did NOT hold their ground and left a lot of profit on the table. GO LONG! Those who recently got on board probably did not buy to make a few pennies or dollars, they bought to HODL and drive the HF's to the wall. Logic would dictate that with all that is going on, there is a tremendous community that has banded together on AMC. We longs probably own well over the float, unfortunately we just don't know. GO LONG! This is not financial advice, only the way I view all this. With all the odd things going on with this stock, how could a person not want to have at least a small handful of shares? If this goes epic, and that is "if", I know I want to be a part of it both financially and figuratively. GO LONG! The stock is probably approaching a point were another twenty to forty million shares owned that will HODL and the stranglehold of the float will be complete (if it is not complete already). I bought more late yesterday, why would I not buy twenty or fifty or hundred dollar bills when they are under fourteen dollars? It is a no brainer. Again, this is all my conjecture, I'm sure I will hear from bashers/shills, but bottom line, once this goes over fourteen I will be profitable on EVERY single share that I own. If you agree, and are smart enough to buy more, thumbs up, so our long brothers and sisters can see this all day LONG, Get it, LONG. GO LONG! Oh, and if you are short, and getting roasted, guess what? Nobody really cares!

Good Morning All! I see there is no shortage of "OMG this is taking so long" FUD here this morning. I will hold a position in this company forever, beyond a squeeze, cause I support the company and also the freedom of being able to watch great movies on the big screen as originally designed. In-theater movies are our family thing on birthdays - each choses the one they want and everyone goes along. I will do my part to support that tradition whatever it takes. If this never got to be anything but a $25 stock spinning off an eventual dividend, I can live with that. Obviously much bigger things are in store, but wanted to share my thoughts. Patience is key and wish all of you lots of it (along with much wealth and good health, of course!) Have a good day and feel free to join me in the pond!

REPOST: Please file SEC complaint against Citadel. You can copy my message. https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.html

Dear Chairman Gensler,

I am writing to you as a concerned investor. I currently own many shares of the AMC Entertainment company, along with shares of other companies to a lesser degree.

My biggest concern is the not-so-level playing field, on which we as individual investors are forced to compete against hedge funds. This is not a new phenomenon but something that has been going on now for decades. I will try to keep this brief and just state a few issues, all of which as SEC chairman you already know.

Hedge funds are stock market predators who have destroyed investments and caused financial ruin and bankruptcy to millions of those investors over the years, along with many companies, all for personal greed and gain. The biggest offender appears to be Citadel, although many other hedge funds also participate in illegal market activities to some degree. Any reference to Citadel will also include other hedge funds as well.

In 2020, Citadel decided to make AMC its next victim to short into insolvency, so they tried the same tactics that they’ve been allowed to get away with before to destroy another company and everyone’s hard earned money who invested.

Citadel engaged in naked shorting, which was outlawed years ago, but rules don’t seem to matter to them, especially when the penalty for a company with 35 billion in assets is a $300 fine that they laugh at and consider a normal cost of doing business. Therefore, the practice is still being used regularly with what appears to be almost total impunity.

The naked shorting was then followed by FTDs. If hedge funds can bankrupt a company, they don’t ever have to deliver on all of those FTDs, which was clearly the goal, so they got too greedy and thought what worked before surely would again. Their only problem this time was retail investors finally had enough and rose up together to save our beloved movie theater industry. If you or family and friends ever decide to visit a local movie theater anytime in the future, you have us to thank for being able to do so.

Now with all of the naked shorting and shares that Citadel has failed to deliver, there are probably billions of fake or phantom shares that don’t actually exist. The current float for AMC stock is approximately 483 million shares. The total number of shares owned by retail, institutions, insiders, and shorted shares equals way more than that. The entire float of AMC for certain periods of time is being bought and sold many times over, an impossibility, considering over 80% of the float is owned by retail traders. It’s right there for the whole world to see. How does this happen and they continue to get away with it? A sensible solution to me is, a share recount for AMC needs to be conducted immediately to uncover this fraud and abuse. I can only imagine the numbers will be shocking as the corruption is revealed.

Brokerages are routing trade orders to Citadel in exchange for cash rebates. When Citadel is shorting a stock and retail traders place buy orders for that stock, Citadel routes those buy orders to dark pools to hide them so that the demand is not being included, which makes the supply appear greater, which causes downward price action.

Citadel also pays media outlets to run hit pieces on companies they are currently trying to short into oblivion. There are even social media boards that Citadel has invested in that delete some of our comments if they are in support of AMC.

All of this is nothing less than organized crime. The hammer needs to drop once and for all, even if it means issuing margin calls and liquidating assets. If they’re not going to play by the rules and we can’t have fair and open markets then they should no longer exist. The markets need to be returned to hard working, honest investors who just want to be able to invest in their favorite companies without fear of price manipulation by these criminals driving businesses into insolvency time after time. The stock market has evolved into something where investors can no longer buy stocks based on solid fundamentals, strong balance sheets, etc., but based on which stocks the hedge funds aren’t currently shorting into bankruptcy.

We, as individuals, have very little power to make change, but we have come together as one huge voice to make a difference and return the stock market to the people but we could always use your help. As fast as we are buying shares of AMC, the hedge funds continue to short that many in fake shares that aren’t even available to short but are simply being created out of thin air.

You recently pledged to crack down on the fraud and abuse that is rampant among these hedge funds, market makers, brokerages, and everyone else whom the hedge funds have paid off in exchange for favorable treatment. We’re not looking for politics as usual anymore.

Thank you for your time.

Melvin Capital suffered 49% loss 1st quarter!
Community, this is massive. Melvin Capital is a hedge fund that has been shorting both AMC and GME stock. These are the people trying to drive the stock to the ground.
Melvin Capital suffered a 49% loss it’s first quarter of 2021, via. Markets Insider. Unfortunately for them, this is only going to get worse.
Retail investors are hodling to the moon. They are not waiting for $100 price action anymore, and some are certainly not waiting for $500+ share price anymore. The Reddit community is set new standards for the AMC’s stock price.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) shares came out of the gate strong today, giving Redditors cause to celebrate even as the company’s biggest shareholder, Dalian Wanda Group, ran for the exits last week. Famous Reddit forum WallStreetBets has led the rally in the AMC stock price this year as the group of individual investors looks to turn the tables on short-selling hedge funds and leave them holding the bag in the interim — just as they did with GameStop (GME) stock.

While Reddit investors’ risky gambit continues to play out in their favor, short-sellers are feeling the pain for a change. AMC is one of the three most shorted stocks alongside GME and Virgin Galactic (SPCE), all of which are trading in the green today. Short-sellers are at risk of losing close to USD 400 million across this trio of stocks as a result of today’s activity alone, as per financial analytics firm Ortex.

Correct me if I am wrong but AMC can explode before 2nd of June at any time now because it’s a no brainer that there are millions of synthetic shares which hedge funds needs to cover and they won’t take risk doing it after the count. They will probably start it this week and we are about to see a massive price change which could be anywhere from $100 to $1000 or more.

7 things the Motley Stool isn't telling its subscribers.
1. They own and run a hedge fund, 1623 Capital
2. They are being paid by large hedge funds to post these hit articles on AMC.
3, Their disclaimers in the past have shown that several Motley Stool writers have taken short positions in AMC.
4. Motley Stool is offering up to 50% off of its premium stock picking services, Why? Most likely because they are losing members as a result of the exposure from their non-stop infatuation with AMC.
5. The Motley Stool is pumping the Disney stock they own in order to profit from their subscribers.
6. Disney stock, the darling of the Motley Stool portfolio is down in value since the beginning of 2021 while AMC stock is soaring, Up significantly from its January 4th price of $2.01.
7. The most important thing the Motley Stool will never disclose, They are by definition a PUMP & DUMP operation on a grand scale.

These are the items that Apes need to know about the Motley Stool. Anything else that Williams and the Stool have to say about AMC and its' shareholders it pure garbage and until they become a legit investment advisor service they should really focus on what they have made money on in the past. Stick to pumping not trashing. By the way, Williams and the Motley Stool are really bad at trashing a stock. After all, the stock they are attempting to trash is UP HUGE since they started their hit campaign.

The Stool has no credibility left,. I for one hope that they are also cleaned out by the mission of the Ape Army.

“Massive Victims” in GameStop and AMC Stock Manipulation

Jordan Belfort says that those jumping on board a handful of stocks that are going through the roof due to Reddit users are playing with fire.

The Wolf of Wall Street author and film subject said in an interview with CNN Business that something illegal is likely going on as stocks such as GameStop and AMC have skyrocketed via hype mostly on Reddit.

“If you could prove that they are actually colluding together, then that would be illegal,” said Belfort, who amassed a fortune in the 1990s as a stockbroker in New York City with his own firm before spending 22 months in prison for fraud and corruption. He published his memoir, The Wolf of Wall Street, in 2007, which was adapted into a 2013 Martin Scorsese film with the same name starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

##############################
The stock is selling every time it approaches $14. Probably won't be able to break that resistance today. however, Eventually the sellers will be done and it'll be clear sailing!

Everyone needs to hold as long as you can I see people saying sell at 500$ but we hold all the shares that they need, we control the price they buy back from if you get to excited sell 10% you don’t want to miss the potential of this. It is actually feasible for the SP to hit over 100k everyone has to be on the same page though. So hold strong and create generational wealth not just for you for your family, it will happen.

Total outstanding shares 490 millions, minus restricted shares = float. There were 3.2 million shareholders in US and Canada alone as of 3/11. Safe to assume shareholders now worldwide are at least 4 million. If each owns 150 shares on average that’s 600 million shares. I happen to believe the average is way more than 150 shares. How is it possible the total share count is more than what’s issued? Because there are a lot synthetic shares hedggies created and shorted, and the good news is hedggies will have to buy back all the shares they shorted at some point.

Their only problem this time was retail investors finally had enough and rose up together to save our beloved movie theater industry. If you or family and friends ever decide to visit a local movie theater anytime in the future, you have us to thank for being able to do so.

Now with all of the naked shorting and shares that Citadel has failed to deliver, there are probably billions of fake or phantom shares that don’t actually exist. The current float for AMC stock is approximately 483 million shares. The total number of shares owned by retail, institutions, insiders, and shorted shares equals way more than that. The entire float of AMC for certain periods of time is being bought and sold many times over, an impossibility, considering over 80% of the float is owned by retail traders. It’s right there for the whole world to see. How does this happen and they continue to get away with it? A sensible solution to me is, a share recount for AMC needs to be conducted immediately to uncover this fraud and abuse. I can only imagine the numbers will be shocking as the corruption is revealed.

Brokerages are routing trade orders to Citadel in exchange for cash rebates. When Citadel is shorting a stock and retail traders place buy orders for that stock, Citadel routes those buy orders to dark pools to hide them so that the demand is not being included, which makes the supply appear greater, which causes downward price action.

Citadel also pays media outlets to run hit pieces on companies they are currently trying to short into oblivion. There are even social media boards that Citadel has invested in that delete some of our comments if they are in support of AMC.

All of this is nothing less than organized crime. The hammer needs to drop once and for all, even if it means issuing margin calls and liquidating assets. If they’re not going to play by the rules and we can’t have fair and open markets then they should no longer exist. The markets need to be returned to hard working, honest investors who just want to be able to invest in their favorite companies without fear of price manipulation by these criminals driving businesses into insolvency time after time. The stock market has evolved into something where investors can no longer buy stocks based on solid fundamentals, strong balance sheets, etc., but based on which stocks the hedge funds aren’t currently shorting into bankruptcy.

We, as individuals, have very little power to make change, but we have come together as one huge voice to make a difference and return the stock market to the people but we could always use your help. As fast as we are buying shares of AMC, the hedge funds continue to short that many in

I don’t particularly like the VW comparison because it was a very different situation which involved a discrete buyout. The best and easiest comparable here is Tesla.

I just averaged the number of shares owned by 65 shareholders who happened to post their number of shares today. Some had single-digit shares, others in the tens of thousands. It came out to an average of 3,225 shares per investor. Multiply that by 3.2 million investors in the US and Canada, and we get to 10.3 BILLION shares. It is likely there are billions of synthetics out there. It's time to take back our power.

So we have reached the last week of May. The interest collector will come knocking on Friday. Millions upon millions of shares were borrowed this month. Interest in May was all over the place some as high as 90% some days. I would assume crypto is being used to cover some of this expense.

If we make a push this week we could really continue driving a dagger into the shorts.

I continue to track options, and June 18th is just insanely out of the ordinary. Remember as well the more they drive this stock down like last week, call options that are OTM but have a much more realistic shot of falling ITM are now being bought up at much cheaper prices.

Smart money takes advantage of this by buying say $11.50 $12.00 and $12.50 options 3 weeks out. This in turn puts more heat on shorts and gives them less leeway and a narrower path because the spread is now being closed on them as to a safe price zone.

Keep up the good work folks. Lets tighten the vice this week and see what pops

AMC investors: Be careful.

Hedge funds may be trying to get investors to sell by allowing the share price to run up. Do not fall for hedge funds tactics. They will run price, entice investors to sell, then ladder the price down.

If you can afford to hold, continue to do so, since selling when the share price is up a few cents or even a buck is only a 'pittance'. We are expecting more upside and much higher than these current numbers.

For those who have been holding and not selling, if you have come this far, a little longer will not cost you anything.

Good to be a long holding ape of AMC shares, originally I was thinking of making $300k to $600k total on AMC stock, now that the time has been stretched out for months and we truly understand the damage the hedges have done to themselves it will be well worth the wait, my new price per share since this new found information is $100k + per share allowing me to make millions instead of $200,000 total.

3) pay attention to Tomorrow’s and Thursday’s hearing between Banks and Senate Financial Committee and House Financial Committee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4) check NY Fed. Org: Fed is lending short term loan to banks around $390 billion dollars on a daily bases meaning printing too much money and injecting them into the market
( HYPERINFLATION)
5) a massive Disruption of Repo and Reverse repo market between banks , Hedges, and Firms

Sometimes, it’s better to squeeze a pimple that is ready to be popped and let it heal properly. If left untreated, it may develop into aggressive cellulitis!!!!!!! IMHO

Are there unknown third parties involved in this cascade of imbalance to keep them afloat?????

This is again the inevitable MOASS.

This is the only stock that has undervalued share price when comparing to pre-pandemic price (<20) and got potential to bring multiple times higher gains in the near future because of highly accumulated and built up short amount.

Fintel is showing the AMC shares available to borrow have dropped to just 150,000 from upwards of 3 million yesterday. But the short borrow rate has continued to decrease..now 5% was 7% yesterday...short borrow fee should be headed back up

##############################
we got this, we're too strong of an army for them, only 100,000 shares left per stonk tracker, they strated out with 2,100,000 shares just this morning and went thru 2,000,000 shares to drop it 12 cents !

even at 2,100,000 shares, there's 3 million of us, that's less than 1 share per person, it's a losing battle for the HF, and they know it now.

Interesting that we are approaching 7am and no one has borrowed additional shares as of yet today. Volume is all we need, another 110 million should without a doubt drive this to $15. Lets see if we can sustain this momentum this week, There is no Wanda to hold us back. The ball is in our court

Just realized I've invested almost an entire years salary into amc at this point and I'm completely comfortable with having that much skin in the game.

##############################
##############################
Help me to understand this, but I don't think I'm far off here...

Let's say that 80% of retail were to sell today (won't happen), but let's just say they did. The squeeze would still happen, correct? Wouldn't the remaining 20% still get to set their price and get it?

If there are billions of synthetic shares in the market today, they'd still need to be bought up. If 80% of retail sold off - it would give the HF's approximately 392 million shares. But they'd STILL need to account for the hundreds of millions of synthetics shares as well as the 92 million shares that would still be held by retail.

Am I off in my thinking that there is just about nothing that could stop the squeeze at this point? Even a mass selloff in retail wouldn't stop it...

Per Adam Aron, critical distinctions: the updated share-count (shares issued and outstanding) will be completed & released on June 2 (or "first week of June"), while the vote recount starts on June 2nd and ends on July 29.

In order to qualify to attend and vote at the rescheduled shareholder meeting on July 29, apes must own shares (i.e., "be on record") before Wednesday, June 2. Also, please note that your share purchase(s) must have settled (i.e., "been on record") before June 2 in order to be included in the share-count. If you buy on June 2, your shares may not settle for 1-3 business days thereafter, and you will not qualify to attend the meeting, vote, or have your shares counted. So, to be safe, you should buy shares no later than Friday, May 28 because the markets are closed on Monday, May 31 for Memorial Day.

Email response from AMC regarding share-count and vote-count:

"If you own shares as of June 2, 2021, the brokerage firm that holds your shares will provide you with updated proxy and voting information. If your brokerage firm does not allow voting, you can do two things:

1. Contact our proxy solicitor after the new proxy materials are issued to see if they can confirm your ownership, and if they can, you can vote through them. The information about our proxy solicitor will be available when we update the proxy materials. Be sure to sign up for AMC news here:


2. Transfer your shares to a brokerage firm that does allow voting.

I'm in China. We love stocks. I personally own 25,000 shares. My private clients and family combined own 75,000 shares. I'm sure you guys and girls own at least 1000 shares. 1000 x 1 million people = 1 billion shares. Amc only has 450 million shares. So the supply is gone but the stock is only $12. The demand is ruined by the synthetic and naked shares. We are winning. This stock is going to the moon so don't worry. It's not like my other stock HCMC which has like 307 Billion shares. Amc has a share count. If we technically own it all with the other big company holders than why is it $12. Think about it. I'm not making this up. You can do your DD.

Let's think about this. Wanda sold these shares into the open market - over a period of time where HUGE retail volume was on this stock.

We also have seen the short interest numbers form Ortex, etc. What does this tell us? Wanda's shares are likely *majority* in retail hands, now. Not only is this not a bad thing, it may even be a strong positive.

It's becoming clear, that selling pressure from them stifled a large run up. They no longer have enough shares to do that again...

And, what's more, a larger % of AMC is owned by retail, now. We are more in control of this company's future than ever before, in my opinion....

Firstly, it is no secret that Yahoo finance is participating in the AMC corruption. They delete investors accounts while allowing paid shills to 'roam free'.

Additionally, Joshua Rodriquez from CNA posted a great article for which I hope everyone was able to read. Article is dated 5/19/21. He believes that many are involved as his articles are being pushed to the second and third page news for AMC with the hope that interested investors do not have the opportunity to read.

Anyone seeing something that looks strange, save it as it might be needed in the near future.

I'm in China. We love stocks. I personally own 25,000 shares. My private clients and family combined own 75,000 shares. I'm sure you guys and girls own at least 1000 shares. 1000 x 1 million people = 1 billion shares. Amc only has 450 million shares. So the supply is gone but the stock is only $12. The demand is ruined by the synthetic and naked shares. We are winning. This stock is going to the moon so don't worry. It's not like my other stock HCMC which has like 307 Billion shares. Amc has a share count. If we technically own it all with the other big company holders than why is it $12. Think about it. I'm not making this up. You can do your DD.

👉 Smething to ponder about over the weekend. App. 50+ million shares where sold off in the last week. (AMC & Wanda ). This resulted in a nearly similiar share price week over week. Now. This shows 2 things.
1. The buying power strength behind this stock and its holders
2. Harder to explain.. AMC stock is consistently held. Which means until someone sells the price is staying flat. Now this week we had sellers so price went up. Seem bad? NO. This proves that if we hold and eventually shorts do cover. The buy spread would drastically gap because less buyers. If nobody sells for a .01, .05, .10, or a 1 spread then eventually shorts have to buy the gap. Maybe 10, 20, or possible 100+.
This is exactly what eventually happened to GME. Bears will thumbs down this, but still cant explain the GME gap to $468.
Only proves hedgie gains ground when someone sells at low spreads.
BUYING & HOLDING AMC!

Tony compiled this DD,
This needs to be sent to as many as you can, local TV and papers, national, HELL I'm sending to my state attorney general ....any place I can think of and then some THANK YOU TONY, for All this INFO

2) According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers, Citadel was providing payment-for-order-flow (giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it) to each of the following: Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade and TradeStation.

At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities.

Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation,

Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options. On top of that Citadel also has access to all user data. Unreal this is not illegal. Would you expect anything else?

3) Facebook - Over $1 billion dollars invested in Facebook gives them some clout as witnessed yesterday with AMC groups closed and a Robinhood controlled AMC page opening

4) Sean Williams and countless other hack writers being paid in crypto to blast AMC

5) Marketwatch - Owned by News Corp. Citadel recently added over 6.6 million shares of News Corp in the last quarter and now have over 23 million shares per Fintel. Not only does News Corp own Marketwatch but they also own Barron's and The Wall Street Journal

6) Motley Fool we all know about

7) CNBC - In 2007 Citadel partnered with CNBC which is owned by NBCUniversal. Citadel purchased ION Networks. CITADEL and NBCUniversal have a very good working relationship. Hmmm MADMONEY is on CNBC right? That would be Jim Cramer.

8) Bloomberg - Since 2013 has had a relationship with Citadel - Citadel, a leading global financial institution, is now using Bloomberg’s Fixed Income Trading platform for electronic trading and clearing of interest rate swaps.

9) Interactive Brokers - In the year 2018, IBUK started routing to CITADEL which fills client orders inside the bid/ask spread and at no execution cost chargeable by CITADEL to the client.

Here’s how I think it’s going to work:

1. AA gives some information on the share recount as to what they know so far. The share recount will portray more shares outstanding than legally administered and distributed by the company.

2. SEC will HAVE to step in, no matter how deep their pockets are filled in by HF’s, and take action. Likely the 002 rule will be passed within a few days after AA speaks, and margin calls will begin right away to keep the credibility and integrity of the SEC, because if the SEC doesn’t do anything after they find out the HF’s have been diluting a stock by creating synthetic shares, then what is the point of their existence, their reputation will be gone down the drain and the American market will lose all its credibility, which they dare won’t allow.

Monday we go back up!

From WSJ. Wanda also sold other AMC shares earlier in the year. Wanda now owns 10,000 of AMC’s Class A shares, or 0.002% of the total shares outstanding. No single entity holds an ownership stake above 10%, AMC said.
“With no controlling shareholder in place, now AMC will be governed just as is most other publicly traded companies, with a wide array of shareholders,” Mr. Aron said during a March earnings call.
##############################
##############################
The selling this week was as expected NOT Retail but it was WANDA.

There are many hypothesis as to why and it does fit well within that thought process, but for me I am happy this selling pressure is gone and that those shares are now in the hands of retail.

If you look into their past reason to sell which is well documented China had requested that companies within China call back foreign investments to strengthen domestic growth.

Couldn't be happier with this news!
##############################
##############################
for those of you that don't necessarily fully compute what you read, Wanda sold their remaining shares to apes they didn't get sold in block trades to investment companies in the dark pool. This is likely another level of the game you don't understand yet keeping these shares in the hands of individual investors, sounds like AA may have had something to do in this. here is the quote from the official release.
The shares were all sold through normal open market trading to a widely dispersed array of buyers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Adam Aron states that the 3.2 Million share holders previously mentioned are ONLY CANADA AND USA numbers (only ones that can vote their shares), there could be MILLIONS more around the world! I am officially 100000% sure there are an insane amount of synthetics. The numbers just aren't adding up, it's obvious at this point. 3.2 million shareholders at an average of 150 shares per person (probably much higher then that) is enough to own the entire float. Throw in institutional ownership and global shareholders and we have a situation in which any purchases currently being made are synthetics. I don't know HOW they're getting away with this but when this eventually does squeeze, the addition of synthetics will make is squeeze much, much more. We know what they're doing, and we know our battle plan. 💎🙌

##############################
##############################
So they are trying to pit AMC against GME. My thoughts is once margin call occurs it will not be because of one stock or another but because of the lack of liquidity and the burden of liability.

So, if one goes they all go because they will be required to sell assets to cover liability this is not selective to one holding, it is their balance sheet and there will only be one chance to clean up their mess.

Don't fall for the Fud.

THE WEEKEND THOUGHT: Not listing my share count any more, to much neg feedback about that. But I wish I could own more. So these are "ifs". They are just my thoughts, not financial advice, just to be clear. This is how I see this whole situation. "If" there is a large short position, then would it be prudent to NOT disclose any information about how dire the situation that you were in if you were an entity that had such a large short position? I know I would NOT divulge any info that would harm my short position. The last thing I need is for all of Wall Street to know that I was short to the gills! Now let us reverse all this. "If" the social media was claiming there is a HUGE short position on AMC, and your HF had a minimal short position, let's say 8-10 million shares short, wouldn't it be wise to open your books to all to see that you are not short this HUGE short position? Think about all this. Not a word from HF world about NOTHING. The average investor really has no clue what the size of the short position is. Sure, you could buy into some of the drips and drabs of info. Problem is, every where you look, the numbers are all way different. My thinking is that "if" there was NOT a huge, HUGE, short position, the HF would make this all public knowledge. I know I would be more cautious about owning if there was only a small short position. But since there is NO accurate news, I have to strongly assume there is a HUGE short position. The only real question is how big! Someday we will know, and they will probably make a movie about all this (it will be in AMC theaters, maybe I could be a star, j/k of course). If you agree with this, hit a thumbs up so our long brothers and sisters can see this over the weekend. The tell tale signs are there that there is a lot of shenanigans going on with this stock. This kind of stuff does not go on for no reason. With Wall Street there is a reason for everything. And the reason is always MONEY. Have a great weekend, this could be the last discount weekend to this stock. The show is in the third act.

📣📣Remember📢📢
Do not forget that the Hedge Funds will try to create psychological pressure on all shareholders! They will let the price rush to maybe 30-60 $ then they will stimulate one or more price crashes to make everyone panic. Do not forget then that there are 149 million shares that they have borrowed from us, not to mention all the synthetic shares that are certainly up in the billion now if not more. They MUST buy back all the shares before the squeeze has been squozed it will take several days! According to ortex, "Days to cover" is a full 4.2 at the two-week volume, and 1.7 at the 3-month volume. SO KEEP KEEP KEEP! $ 20 is no squeeze, $ 50 is no squeeze, $ 100 is no squeeze $ 1000 + is then we can call it a squeeze🦍💠, with the current number of shares on loan!

There is a reason why they shut everything down and made GME the spotlight during the fist mini squeeze back in January.
I believe they tried to sweep AMC under the rug because GME came close to their dark secret with AMC that had billions of synthetic shares. I mean if you saw what was happing with GME (that happened to be just a heavily shorted stock) could you imagine how bad it would be for them if everyone found out about AMC!?
Obviously shutting down trading was an emergency sacrifice of Robinhood to try to put out the fire.
Well unfortunately all they did was pour gas on it and everyone found out about all the synthetics...
LETS GO
AMC, 100K!!!

im bullish on GME and hold positions in both, we are in this together, so fellow GME apes im not bashing you, but this time around I truly believe AMC will be in the spotlight!

be ready for more price drops, be ready for more manipulation, but if we hold through the highs and the lows we can reach the 4th dimension. eff the moon, lets go multi dimensional on this bee!

Love you all, K

Per Fed Today, $394.94B Reverse Repo, The Highest in History. (same-day loan to participants (mostly bankers)).
I believe a lot of bankers couldn't meet SLR due to various reasons. One of reason I believe is that Bankers intentionally defer the margin calls to their clients (mostly big HFs) in order to prevent various clients' defaults and insolvencies.

Hi Ape Fam, I watched "The Big Short" over the weekend (2008 mortgage crisis) and it really opened my eyes up to how corrupt the whole system is! From banks, to hedge funds to S+P Ratings system and even higher up! I recommend you guys to watch when you have time. Let's HODL - and remember this is possibly the last possible event. Do we want to settle for $90 profit per share of $99k per share? Let's change our lives and hand down wealth to the next generation. The ability to ensure that the next generation does not have to report to a job that they hate is what is making me HODL - I hope you all are doing the same. Stay strong and support each other. Buy dips (you can buy 1 or 2 shares if that is all you can afford) and remember to tell your friends and family. Let's make everyone wealthy. What good is being a multi-millionaire if my friends aren't as well? We got this. "New Money" - we are taking over!

The share count is only for the apes is the US and Canada.
I believe we are about 35k apes in Sweden at this point. My brokerage says a little over 23k and someone else said that they were 14k at another brokerage if I remember correctly so a conservative number is 35k but could be up to 40k at this point. Anyway now let’s say we own 200 shares each as an average, that’s 7 million shares. This is for only ONE country in Europe. Not even counting other parts of the world, I repeat just ONE country in Europe. And in my opinion that’s a pretty conservative number of shares we potentially hold over here.
Now if the share count is showing that the US and Canada hold over 100% of the float you can just imagine all the naked shares out there. ( I know we already have speculations about this but I just wanna share some extra info / thoughts about this )

Why demand for Fed’s reverse repo facility is surging again
Published: May 24, 2021 at 9:04 p.m. ET
By Joy Wiltermuth

A key artery of global financial markets may be telling the Federal Reserve that enough is enough.

Demand for an overnight funding through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s overnight reverse repo program (RRP) has begun to flirt with recent records highs, after almost no one used it for months.

Daily repo usage jumped to $394.94 billion on Monday after topping $369 billion on Friday, its highest level since the end of June 2017, according to Tradeweb data.

The Fed’s reverse repo program lets eligible firms, like banks and money-market mutual-funds, park large amounts of cash overnight at the Fed in exchange for a small return, which lately has fallen to about 0.06%.

The program had almost no customers in early April, and few since the pandemic’s onset last spring, but daily demand in recent weeks has shot up dramatically. This chart shows the spike in reverse repo demand since April 1.

Spike in reverse repo demand CURVATURE SECURITIES
“Why are they going to the Fed?” asked Scott Skyrm, executive vice president in fixed income and repo at Curvature Securities, of firms wanting reverse repo funding, despite its dwindling returns.

“Either there is too much cash or not enough collateral,” he told MarketWatch. “It’s two sides of the same coin.”

It’s also pretty much the opposite of what happened in September 2019, when repo rates suddenly skyrocketed, resulting in the Fed jumping in with a slate of short-term emergency lending facilities that helped calm fears that financial markets might otherwise freeze up.

This time, Skyrm views high demand for the Fed’s low-return reverse repo facility as a sign that the central bank’s roughly year-old $120 billion-a-month bond-buying program no longer works as intended by adding liquidity to financial markets, and should be scaled back.

“Right now, the more money you put in, you get it right back,” he said. “The market is saying ‘It’s time.’ There is the evidence that QE has gone too far.”

This chart shows the recent spike in reverse repos at the Fed as nearing peak levels of the past decade.

Demand for reverse repos nears peak levels BTIG
The Fed, under Chairman Jerome Powell, has purchased $2.5 trillion in bonds since the pandemic broke out last year, through its monthly purchases of U.S. Treasurys TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.579% and agency mortgage bonds, or “quantitative easing” (QE).

“This adds liquidity to the system. As the Fed buys bonds, those sellers receive the liquidity and likely buy other bonds, or other product,” Padhraic Garvey, ING’s global head of debt and rates strategy, wrote in a client note Monday.

“The thing is, the liquidity is being placed here as there is nowhere else for it to go to,” Garvey wrote of the Fed’s reverse repo program. “And it’s not really where you want to park cash, given that the rate paid to the cash lender is 0%.”

Overnight reverse repo rates have been sinking to the low end of the Fed’s target policy rates, currently in the zero to 0.25% range.

As MarketWatch reported in April, the worry is that the U.S. central bank could be on the brink of losing control of its benchmark policy rates, without making other tweaks to stabilize rates.

Read: Here’s why a flood of cash could be creating a conundrum for the Fed

Meanwhile, Powell has promised “great transparency” around the Fed’s eventual exit of easy monetary policies. Several Fed officials recently called for the central bank to start discussing a slowdown of its bond purchases, while the latest minutes of the rate-setting committee meeting showed a willingness to explore the topic in coming meetings.

A BTIG Research team led by Julian Emanuel described the situation like a game of cat and mouse.

High demand for the Fed facility “underscores pressures on the short end of the yield curve as near-term rates probe negative territory after a year-plus of extraordinary accommodative policy,” the team wrote in a Sunday note.

But they also expect the issue to last “until investors are confident enough to shift to longer-duration bonds,” which isn’t expected to happen until markets get more clarity on the Fed’s plans to taper its bond purchases.

Their holdings, along with Vanguard are key factors I look at in deciding my individual plays in the world of insanity where it is all about anticipating what criminals will do next, while intrinsic value means nothing.

Crazy Horse the squeeze won't happen because it is too dilute.

Bahahah well bud the ONLY reason it is diluted is because of the introduction of synthetic shares to Short thus what has caused the HF to be at risk for a squeeze.

You would think after a few months of this the bashers would be better.

I shared this on Wednesday.. the 3 month daily average of AMC on 5/19 was at 97.51 million per day.. Multiply by 91 days of rolling 3 month average and this added up to 8,873,410,000 BILLION SHARES TRADED, in the last 3 months. Which would mean the entire float would be bought and sold over 19 x times.. How is that possible if 80% of The float is owned?? this keeps getting deleted btw.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



AMC ENTERTAINMENT PRAISES WANDA’S NEAR DECADE LONG

OWNERSHIP OF INDUSTRY LEADING MOVIE THEATRE COMPANY



LEAWOOD, KANSAS - (May 21, 2021) -- AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest operator of movie theatres, announced today that its heretofore largest shareholder, the Wanda Group, has sold this week most of its remaining shares in the movie theatre company. The shares were all sold through normal open market trading to a widely dispersed array of buyers on the New York Stock Exchange.



Wanda acquired all of AMC in 2012, and took the Company public through a 2013 IPO while still retaining a majority of AMC’s total outstanding shares.



At last count, AMC had more than 3 million individual shareholders, with no single entity having an ownership stake above 10%.



Commenting on this development, AMC CEO and President Adam Aron said, “Wanda has been a terrific shareholder of AMC for almost a decade. Under their ownership, AMC became the biggest movie theater operator in the world. Importantly, Wanda also has supported our reinvesting billions of dollars to upgrade and enhance our network of theatres for the benefit of moviegoers throughout the United States, Europe and the Middle East. I salute Wanda for the immensely constructive role they played in building our company, and want to express my sincerest appreciation and affection for their wise counsel and friendship.”



The U.S., Europe and China are the three largest movie markets in the world. Wanda Film Group owns the largest movie theatre circuit in China, with additional theatres throughout Australia, and also makes Chinese-language films. AMC is the largest movie theatre circuit in the United States and the largest movie theatre circuit across Europe, with additional theatres in the Middle East. Even after the stock sale, Wanda Film Group and AMC will enter into a long term strategy and cooperation agreement, which will facilitate efficiencies through global purchasing efforts and the sharing of best practices. Some of the films made by Wanda will also be shown at select AMC Theatres. This continuing communication between the two companies should create a win-win situation for both Wanda Film Group and for AMC in the cinema and film industries.



Consistent with the sale of most their remaining AMC shares, both Lincoln Zhang and John Zeng expect to resign their seats on the AMC Board of Directors sometime within the next thirty days.



About AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.

AMC is truly a win-win scenario buying at a price below $20 per share. smartest move I've made in all my years
##############################
##############################
So you're telling me all I have to do is buy and hold to make a lot of money and destroy manipulators that have been hurting my other stocks for years? Sign me up. Not financial advice of course.
##############################
##############################
If enough people will push it past $14 I will add another 1000 shares.
##############################
##############################
We will buy all the day traders shares and more if needed. We will not stop. Day traders and shorties will not affect our strategy of buying and holding strong - green, red or purple.

Shorts know this and it’s driving them crazy. Their tactics for years are not working on us.

This is just the beginning
##############################
##############################
AMC would be a trending ticker on Yahoo right now, but we all know Yahoo is Anti-AMC
##############################
##############################
At the time of this post, AMC is up 8.70% which is great but we have a long way to go. All we have to do is hold, That's it!!! For newer investors who are still trying to wrap their heads around what's going on, know that the AMC family is here to guide you along the way and answer any questions you may have. As a newer investor you may read negative posts created by paid individuals (Who pose as AMC investors) who claim to hate AMC but in reality have no skin in the game. They simply chose a short lived career in false information and hate towards something they don't even fully understand. There are 5 bashers on YF at any given time but please remember that there are approximately 3,200,000 of us as of a few weeks ago but I personally believe that the number has grown to a minimum of 4,000,000 but likely closer to 5,000,000. So if my math is correct and there are 5 bashers (At any given time) and 5,000,000 of us then that means the haters make up .001% of the AMC population whereas the believers make up 99.9999999999%.
##############################
##############################
My friend I drunkenly told about AMC on Saturday is panic buying and looking at me like I invented gold. I don't even remember what I said.

I came a cross new tactic. Green day hold. Red day buy. 1% down buy 1 share.6% down buy 6shares etc.
##############################
##############################
Ah yes, another morning ritual hit piece by Sean Williams.

If he’s so convicted that AMC is a bad stock, he wouldn’t need to write so many if any articles about AMC, because in the end, it’s our money and if we lose it, why would he care so much if we lost our money.

This only tells me one thing, we are winning.

One of our illustrious bashers was trying to convince people that they aren't doing anything illegal. I posted this quote from the SEC back to him earlier but it disappeared when he deleted his original post. According to the SEC, what they are doing IS manipulation especially since it's in a public setting. Here it is again:

Market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).

Market manipulation may involve techniques including:

Spreading false or misleading information about a company;

Engaging in a series of transactions to make a security appear more actively traded; and

Rigging quotes, prices, or trades to make it look like there is more or less demand for a security than is the case.

There are a myriad of reasons why I'm so happy to hear about China's cutting loose AMC and US retailers taking over. To see AMC in the hands of a country that just allowed and covered up the release of the deadliest, most contagious virus in our lifetime was a sad thing indeed. I feel China already has too much influence in our lives and in my opinion their ownership of AMC at such a level was allowing them to have influence over what types of films are released around the globe and what kind of propaganda they wanted to push. The largest movie theater chain in the world just got reclaimed by the good ol' US of A shareholders and that's the way it should be..! Goodbye Wanda and good riddance..! GO LONGS..!

Be aware of pseudo squeeze, meaning not the true squeeze to make you sell your shares, shorts will allow price to go to $100’s or $$1000 and sell off millions of shares to drop price, do not sell, once we hold past pseudo squeeze and hold they will be out of ammunition, we then continue to hold too $100,000 + per share.
##############################
##############################
first, you're a little late this morning so I'll give you the run down: You paid basher buddies all found out there's no FUD to spread so they're using the "it will never squeeze" method. It should be on page 4 of your handbook.

SEC chair Gensler says agency will enforce rules 'aggressively' against bad actors!
Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said he would be aggressively pursuing bad financial actors who were "playing with working families' savings."
Gensler made his remarks at a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority conference with Robert Cook, president and CEO of FINRA. FINRA is the agency that regulates broker-dealers and exchanges.
As he did in his recent Congressional testimony, Gensler emphasized that enforcement would be a key part of protecting the public.

"At the SEC, we are focused on going after misconduct wherever we find it in the financial system. That means holding individuals and companies accountable, without fear or favor, across the approximately $100 trillion capital markets we oversee," he said.

"We need to do whatever we can to ensure that bad actors aren't playing with working families' savings and that the rules are enforced aggressively and consistently," he told Cook.
##############################
##############################
I made a simple calculation considering there are 3 million shareholders, if:
25% has 10 shares, 25% has 50 shares, 25% has 500 shares, 15% has 1,000 shares and 10% has 2,000 shares that makes a total of 1.47 billions shares.
If the company has around 550 millions shares... then, there are are more than 900 millions naked shares.

If the Brokerage only allows us to sell during the SQUEEZE like they did with GME. I'm just going to hold. And let the Lawsuit begin

##############################
AMC is in the stage of a rebirth, you can sense the desperation of the paid shorties.
##############################
##############################
GME and AMC have more and more APES that own the float and won't sell..and more and more short nitro that must cover....
GME recently went from 500 to 40 to near 180 now....
How many squeezes is that..? and how many to come..? Once GME eclipses 500, people will realize 10,000 and higher is more than possible and actually probable GIVEN time..for both GME and AMC....It's simple supply and demand..
##############################
##############################
A new consensus is developing among apes regarding the tremendous advantage of using "Buy Stop" (a.k.a. "Buy Stop Quote") orders. Since a buy stop order triggers the buy only when the stock price comes up to meet the target price, it creates buying pressure that makes the price per share go up. The opposite is true for a "Buy Limit" order, as the buy doesn't trigger until the stock price goes down to meet the target price, which creates selling pressure that makes the price per share go down.

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse this with a "Stop Loss" order (bad for PPS). The purpose of a stop loss order is to mitigate losses and/or protect gains by way of triggering a sale when the price per share drops more than a predetermined percentage or monetary amount. That creates selling pressure, which is very bad. Conversely, a "Buy Stop" order (good for PPS) triggers a buy when the price per share rises by a predetermined percentage or monetary amount. That creates buying pressure, which is very good. This can be a game-changer if widely adopted by apes.

I stayed home this weekend. That is about $120 saved (eat at home, no going out). It is all going into amc stock on Monday. I think it shoots up big-time this week.

##############################
Been here since before the fiasco in January and would like to say a few words.

Nobody can predict what will happen here. We have a lot of good data to use to make guesses, but the fact is that Wall Street is not transparent. If you come to AMC, you have to be prepared to lay your money on the table and just wait until the opponent shows you his inferior cards. There is no day that is going to make a magic squeeze, we have to stay committed with sustained effort. Keep up the research (DD), stay vigilant, and don't sell. We have to be prepared to look a blood red chart in the face and know that in the end it will mean nothing. Don't be shaken by the fearmongering articles - you know the numbers don't add up for bears. We have to get better at ACTUALLY petitioning the SEC to do something, just crying about it on Yahoo won't do it.

The other thing to know is that the real mission here is so large that it could create massive ripples through the market that cause major damage to other people. It's on us to educate those people on how the game is played and where to play it. We have the ability to come together very easily, we spread info like wildfire, and we support each other. Revolutions don't happen in a single day. Don't let them divide us and build a society that further excludes hardworking people. Copied in case they delete this. Show me that thumb if you're gonna hold em tight.
##############################
##############################
go watch the movie "the big short" and try not to buy more stocks after. being right and going against the grain is what separates you from the rest. you know what's going on, you did your DD, and your confident in yourself. Now just wait. that's all, wait and HODL

i have been an investor for over a decade. i dont read many charts but have been successful using a common sense approach. If this stock is at 12 now coming out of a pandemic, does any one believe that a year from now when things are back to normal this stock will still be at or below this range. i highly doubt it with stadiums. ressturants, flights. clubs and gyms oppenning up people we go back to the theaters and youll be seeing stories on the news about millions of people are going back to see the latest block buster that can only be enjoyed on the big screen.

OK so Wanda sold 30.1 million shares at 14 to 14.98. Great hedgies are the ones who went up there and picked some of them up that is for sure.

So here we are right now at 12.15 on Friday in HF. Guess what, next time we make a run to $14 there is no selling wave going to stop us, and that run is coming real real soon.

We now have a concrete reason why we could not push through the $14.50 wall earlier this week. Makes perfect sense, but going forward expect no other walls.

Congrats on your windfall Wanda and smart move by keeping 10K shares for the squeeze. There is no other reason in the world for you to keep 10K shares unless you like all of us knows what is coming.

Yeah, be careful if you are buying options... I wouldn't be surprised if this is extra manipulated and another bear run-type comes friday like last week (Hence, I said extra, because next week we supposedly have report from CEO)...

People need to keep buying & holding shares if you want to see a price increases... Most likely nothing will happen until we get some regulations stepping in and/or the full share count info...

Please only buy with what you can afford & do not announce your exact position, both entry and exit and it will call fear and such for others..

I am not a financial advisor or is this financial advice, just another LONG ape and AMC lover.

Our volume percentage and price percentage is pretty close to what it was in January for the week before the squeeze. Holding through the weekend could be promising for a high premarket next Monday. This is a meme stock, meaning, we don't care about the fundamentals of the company, we are bringing it to the MOON! WE THE PEOPLE! Buy and hold!

The price will be on a rollercoaster ride for a while. Expect to see highs at $50, $500, and higher. Hedge Funds will be selling their AMC in hopes to trigger a panic. Be patient & hold because we can easily drive up the price far beyond $5,000. After this is all done with, be sure to save for taxes. I'll send Citadel some AMC movie tickets. 😁

##############################
AMC CEO does not control the squeeze. If he could make it happen immediately he would. We keep throwing these dates out there that end up being fodder for the bashers and let downs for new or potential new team members who are still developing their diamond hands.

Nobody knows the date or even if a squeeze will happen. We can be cautiously optimistic but but that is the honest to God truth. The squeeze could start today, tomorrow, or yes, even never.

There have been many good things though that happened on many of the dates we all looked forward to. Those were great milestones but still not the thing that assured a squeeze will start.

What will start the squeeze is not just one thing, there are probably so many strategies being played in the background by all stakeholders, one or a few of things things coming together at the right time will be the gas that lights our fire.

It could be a margin call. It could be a strategic move by AMC with their trusted big investors that they have long relationships with. It could be an SEC or DTTC directive.

The most important things for us retail investors are...

1) Maintaining our convictions and positions
2) Controlling and combatting the negative sentiment by the naysayers
3) Increasing our individual stakes so we can maximize our profits
4) Letting things outside of our control work themselves out without us putting dates on them
5) Planning on how we are going to spend our profits.

All signs are still very much in our favor. Whether you are just here for the squeeze, or you are banking on long term success with AMC in your portfolio, you are in good shape.

In closing..
"Shoot for the Moon and even if you miss you will be among the Stars"

---- What is really happening to AMC-----
---Re posting because yahoo deleted it the first time---
I am going to sum everything up for you in the most simple way possible.
We are a community of strangers and we've been through more challenges together then most close friends do in a life time. So I will be clear when I say this...
We are winning this revolution. Plain and simple.
So... Let me make a basic checklist of tactics they are already using to weaken us. Why because we have "stepped out of line"...
1-False reporting of data (already seen in ortex with short utilization, interest etc)
2-Drive the share price up and then crash it (to destroy our morale)
3-Create false news articles and more recently hijacking trusted social media accounts to spread FUD (seen on AMC facebook group) - Citadel is a major share holder of facebook by the way
4-Create infighting within our community (AMC vs GME and so on) (we are all apes fighting for the same cause)
5-Prepping us to look forward to dates (like the June share recount) so when nothing happens on that date we create our own self destructive FUD.

PLAIN AND SIMPLE

There will be many more tactics used against us, expect it to get harder to hold on to your shares but keep that conviction you had at the beginning because when you least expect it, its going to pop.

They are fighting for their lives right now and don't care about laws anymore and that should give you comfort. Holding is easy, buying is easy. If you are in it for the squeeze then the daily price action does not matter, it is all psychological. At this point they are in too deep for them not to cover. Even the basic false data they are reporting is still looking amazing for us...
so relax, it will take time, get on with your lives and stop worrying about what they are doing or the price action. Stop worrying about dates or future catalysts. stop worrying about what fellow apes are saying or not saying.

-At this point it is a complete exposure of the corruption in our system, a "class warfare" so hold strong, we are winning.

-Love you all, K

Anyone that says AMC100K ISN'T POSSIBLE REMEBER THE FOLLOWING EVENTS 1 - VW had only 12% short interest and flew from 34 to 1080 at king peak of the squeeze which lasted 2 days. 2 - DGAZF was a fund with 46% short interest, it was so bad it was delisted. Flew from 125$ to 25,000$ Both of these stocks weren't even as heavily manipulated as $AMC and $GME. All apes united. Also if anyone says if this is impossible and saying that it's over the world's economy, then ask if they know what geometrical mean is, if they don't, then you know they are FUDs.

to put in to perspective how much the fed would be willing to help pay out a squeeze if it happened in the 12 weeks before the so called pandemic started to deflate the market the fed donated 600 billion a week to the large wallstreet banks to keep the market from crashing. over 6 trillion that's right so divide that by 500 million to get a reasonable amount for a share price, works out to 12,000 a share

I will hold for you first. Then if you can hold as much as you are able for me, I appreciate you a lot. I did not get in for myself and my own profit or I would kept my investment in other stock. But the enthusiasm of Apes and the massive fight they are taken on compelled me to get in and support them right away and for them. Initially, I purchased some very high. Then the longer it dragged, I liked the stock and Apes. I sold all my other stocks and moved over. Honestly, where my investment was, I could have lost 50% by now if I kept with it as it crashed. I will hold for you Apes in gratitude to all you have done and your courage and DD.

The SEC should investigate The Motley Fool for behaving as paid bashers planting hit piece after hit piece distorting AMC's image, lacking entirely in objectivity, highlighting only the worst aspects, and blatantly helping hedge funds engage in price manipulation. Already wrote this but Y! Finance promptly deleted it. If the SEC doesn't sue Motley Fool, then I hope AMC does for negatively distorting its company image. Don't give The Motley Fool a free pass to manipulate investors in favor of their sponsors.
##############################
##############################
The only thing that kind of grinds my gears on this entire experience is how the actors/actresses have not shown more support for AMC or this movement. I know they have seen the billboards, planes and banners in NY, LA and Vegas. You would think they would be vocal about this as well as pumping money into the theater that plays their movies and gets them paid?! Unless they are all on Citadel's payroll! Jk to far out there of a conspiracy. But they should be happy we are saving the place that creates their fame and fortune!

##############################
hedges have brought long positions in AMC, they will let it rise and then sell off with fake news saying the squeeze is over. don't fool for it just hold and buy what you can when they sell off. it will continue to rise after the sell off so we buy and hold. I won't be selling under 10.000 and I will not be selling all my shares at once. maybe 100 at a time. life changing wealth for all involved. we must be patient and allow the process to run its course. the most important thing is that the corupt hedges go bankrupt.

So
Accessing my current situation with this stock, granted I am a short timer/meaning got in and out in the past
Never did much for my meager Fidelity account as far as gains vs losses,,
This time around, about 5-6 weeks
Now, I have set my position with amc stock etc.
I have a decent amount of shares
10K or so, which for me is a lot
and considering that I did not buy in at $3, but that is my decision and I am responsible for my actions-
I am pro amc, been going to their theaters since I was a teenager
Yet my dilemma with continuing to hold is beginning to get abit
Tight as my avrg pps, is getting closer and closer to the current price as it’s been establishing new lows- last few days.
Of course it could surpass that, I could average down
Yet I am not currently in a position to do this, if anything I’d prefer to hold, and buy additional shares, do my best for both myself and continue to contribute and do my part for the overall success for all the amc retail investors, and exposing the corruption and dishonesty that needs no explanation to anyone who cares to read my diatribe.
I am down close to 10 K
As of market close today,,
I pray and hope that this will change and get me right sized and back on track
Also obviously wish anyone genuinely in the fight, and ultimately life changing personal, financial freedom, all the best
I will hang in there for a while longer, then perhaps I will not re-evaluate my own situation as I don’t pass judgment on others
that are “in it, to win it”.

SEC chair Gensler says agency will enforce rules 'aggressively' against bad actors!
Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler said he would be aggressively pursuing bad financial actors who were "playing with working families' savings."
Gensler made his remarks at a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority conference with Robert Cook, president and CEO of FINRA. FINRA is the agency that regulates broker-dealers and exchanges.
As he did in his recent Congressional testimony, Gensler emphasized that enforcement would be a key part of protecting the public.

"At the SEC, we are focused on going after misconduct wherever we find it in the financial system. That means holding individuals and companies accountable, without fear or favor, across the approximately $100 trillion capital markets we oversee," he said.

"We need to do whatever we can to ensure that bad actors aren't playing with working families' savings and that the rules are enforced aggressively and consistently," he told Cook.

A new short squeeze in GameStop and AMC? One social-media sentiment tracker says one is brewing for ‘either today or very soon’ - Published: May 18, 2021 at 12:43 p.m. ET - By Thornton McEnery

Mentions of AMC spiked more than 800% Tuesday morning, while mentions of GameStop soared over 1,400% by volume, according to one social-media tracking platform.

The two biggest “meme” stocks are giving retail investors something to talk about on Tuesday, and leading at least one social-media tracker to predict that another short squeeze may be about to erupt.

GameStop GME, 1.90% and AMC Entertainment AMC, 0.50% got off to very different starts in early trading Tuesday, but raucous social-media chatter around both equities before the opening bell eventually put both stocks back on the same trajectory that they have been on for days.

According to HypeEquity, a platform that compiles social-media activity on individual stocks and uses that data to track what it calls “social sentiment analysis,” said that mentions of AMC spiked more than 800% Tuesday morning, while mentions of GameStop soared over 1,400% by volume.

That surge in popularity augured very differently for the two meme stocks, with AMC moving up for its eighth-straight day while GameStop fell as much as 6% in the first half-hour of trading. In addition to their extremely online popularity, both companies have spent the first half of 2021 leveraging their meme status to get out from major debt loads with significant new equity offerings.

But HypeEquity’s data indicated that GameStop’s day might see a turnaround.

Comments about buying GameStop outpaced those about selling, and while AMC’s social-media action evinced an opposite trend, more than 20% of comments referred to both AMC and GameStop. Perhaps most tellingly, HypeEquity’s data showed that roughly 8% of comments on both stocks included the word “squeeze.”

“When looking at the comments themselves,” said HypeEquity founder Travis Rehl. “There’s a clear desire for a short squeeze either today or very soon.”

Reports of short sellers in GameStop, or those betting for declines in the company’s shares, were circulating widely on Monday, and Tuesday’s early price action combined to create one clear narrative; fighting hedge funds that users believe are renewing their campaign to short the meme stock. So-called meme stocks are ones that tend to be influenced by hype on social media rather than just company fundamentals.

“Remember, their portfolio full of derivatives is nothing against the power of HODLING the stock,” proclaimed Mexicanred1 on r/Superstonk. “There’s only one way this can go… Just up.”

Just after 11 a.m. EST, shares in GameStop appeared to respond to that sentiment, popping more than 4% in less than 10 minutes and going briefly positive on the day. Shares of AMC surged almost 3% in the same period.

At last check, GameStop shares are down 1.1% but had been up nearly 12% so far this week. In the year to date, GameStop’s stock is up nearly 850%, FactSet data show.

Since GameStop’s rise in late January, retail investors have remained bullish on the stock and were re-energized when Keith Gill, the trader on Reddit known as DeepF—ingValue, disclosed that he had doubled down on it.

Meanwhile, AMC shares are climbing 0.6% on the day and have gained more than 8% since the start of the week. For the year, AMC’s stock has risen more than 560%.

I must say, this is setting up beautifully when we squeeze, Crypto is at rock bottom and on super discount, Bluechips will be on discount, dividend stocks will be on discount. Simply amazed at the short term and long term opportunities setting up before us when this squeeze plays out shortly.

We absolutely can achieve generational wealth, for some its all AMC, for others it could be big profits in AMC and reinvesting in bluechips you never thought you could afford at super deflated prices. ETFS and so on.

Do your DD, not only do you want to have an exit strategy in place, you also want to know quickly where to place some profits to ensure security over the long term.

Once in a lifetime opportunity is coming our way. Have a solid plan that fills your needs for the short term and long term. That is how I look at it

** THE DAILY GUIDE TO PAID BASHERS AND SHILLS **

5/24/21 - SHORT INTEREST DATA

It seems that the playbook today is to talk about shares available to short and the decrease in short interest. They are using improvements in the market data to try to convince investors a squeeze is not possible. This is simply untrue. Has the short interest gone down? Yes. Have the about of shares returned gone up? Yes. Have they paid covered the additional 1.5 billion naked synthetic short shares...BIG NO!

Remember folks, GME squeezed with short interest numbers and shares borrowed lower than what we have today and we aren’t even counting the naked shares floating in the market. Buy, hold, and be patient. This is not a question of if, it’s a question of when.

everything we are witnessing the last few days comes from the hedge fund manual on how to pry shares loose from shareholders. tricks of the trade and psychological warfare included. they're all in that manual and there's plenty more where that came from. the point is, this is standard fare with nothing out of the ordinary. they want your shares to cover their massive short position and all we need do is deny them our shares until they go bankrupt. you sell, you lose. you hold, you win. it's a simple straight forward exercise which will result in unimaginable payoffs for us longs. no fear going forward, just create an implacable wall of resistance and we'll all be rewarded handsomely.

Repost :

- AMC raised 2 billion dollars, giving them more liquidity than ever in their 101 year history.
- AMC is the largest Movie theater chain...wait for it...in the World!
- AMC sells more tickets than all of professional sports combined. (That's alot!)
- There are 493 million legitimate shares of AMC and it is believed that short sellers have created over 1 billion(possibly significantly more) synthetic shares of AMC.
- Retail investors(us) own nearly 100% of the free float(493 million shares) and are continuing to purchase the synthetic shares that are being created by short sellers.
-This is a big one...ALL SYNTHETIC SHARES MUST BE BOUGHT BACK BY SHORT SELLERS.
-As of march there were over 3 million retail investors holding shares of AMC and it is likely that number has grown significantly since then.
-Today 5/18/21 was the 8th straight green day in a row for AMC

I shared this on Wednesday.. the 3 month daily average of AMC on 5/19 was at 97.51 million per day.. Multiply by 91 days of rolling 3 month average and this added up to 8,873,410,000 BILLION SHARES TRADED, in the last 3 months. Which would mean the entire float would be bought and sold over 19 x times.. How is that possible if 80% of The float is owned??

There is a lot of really good DD being shared everyday on here. And although I appreciate reading and learning from it, at times it's easy to get "caught up" in all the numbers and information regarding AMC stock.

I think it's a good reminder for us to sometimes take a step back and just simplify the situation somewhat.

What this all really comes down to is Supply and Demand. We know the HF's are absurdly over leveraged and at some point will need to cover all the short shares (real and synthetic) to close out their positions.

We own the float. They will eventually need to come to us to buy our shares and we will name the price. That's really all there is to it. The rest of the numbers, although helpful, are secondary to this one fact.

Let's have a great day Apes. Everyday we hold, we win.

There have been several surveys, but I think this would be more informative. Thumb up if you own 1,000 or more shares, thumbs down if less. Thanks for playing.

If we own all of the AMC shares this stock shouldn't be $12. Think about it. I know at least 10 to 15 close friends/family other traders who own at least 500 to 15000 to 20000 shares each. Now multiple that by the entire world who owns AMC shares. Let's say 1 million to 2 million apes. This # is higher than 486 shares AMC has. So June 2 will be epic
##############################
##############################
The absolute sheer amount of bots/bashers/shills showing up now, all trying to persuade apes to sell, or push them to other stocks, is a very good sign we're ready to take off. Their pure desperation is really showing now. Keep HODLing strong, your bank account will thank you.

Everyone guessing at how many shares are owned by Apes.
I have no specific range but I am 100% confident that we own at least 150% of the float.
I also have yet to see any reason that changes my mind about synthetic shares being in excess of 1.4 billion. These shorts were trying to make bank on the demise of AMC and they got careless and greedy.
This squeeze is going to be massive, unlike anything before it and unlike anything that will ever be allowed to happen again.
Hold all your shares, they are priceless.

I really don’t get why they aren’t trying to cover their loses? Delaying the inevitable is allowing us to buy even more. Talk about would rather lose billions then let us win millions! Buy and hold!

ICC-2021-007 PASSED & APPROVED TODAY !!!!!
https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-10498.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&utm_source=federalregister.gov
This is bigger than ICC-005. This updates margin requirements hedge funds must put up required by brokers to maintain their positions in a trading account, and now the margin requirement can be increased immediately based on the volatility, price fluctuations with their assets (increasing risks in the market, such as risks shorting AMC/GME). These increasing risks could include a predictable short squeeze coming soon.
Mediators between banks and hedge funds are getting wary of the immensely high risks these hedge funds are posing to them.
Based on this ruling, if the account's updated margin (haircut) exceeds the account's capital, the broker can either margin call them or force liquidate their positions until the margin no longer exceeds the capital.
This ruling updates the collateral required for these overleveraged positions, basically they are further mitigating risks, in addition to what they put in ICC-005. Looks like regulators really aren't having it anymore.
They acknowledge in this filing that volatility may be extreme in the near future, and they do not want to be caught holding the bag.
In summary, ICC-007 ensures that even in stressed market conditions, the ICC will continue to collect sufficient collateral from its members and that such collateral could be liquidated in a timely manner to meet financial obligations as a central counterparty (mediator between banks and hedge funds).
ICC-005 was passed and approved just 3 days ago. Now ICC-007 got passed and approved today. Things are moving much quicker than I anticipated.

A lot of people are asking when this will moon.
From my point of view this will moon when shorts will remain without money. This can happen in 2 ways:
I. Longs have to hold. Shorts will be going out of money paying interests, but not immediately. If they loose 930m$ last week this can last for another 4-6 months (it cost shorts 30-40B$).
II. Longs have to buy at market price every day. Price will go up and squeeze can happen in 1-2 months.

Or doing both can go to moon even faster. About 1 month.

So longs, BUY & HOLD & DON't COMPLAIN & DON't WORRY.

We can not be complacent, we need to not just buy and hold but start adding positive search engine comments and statements about AMC entertainment such as AMC has 3.2 million share holders and one billion in cash, AMC entertainment is the largest movie theater chain and most profitable, etc.. this will feed into the algorithms to help boost AMC entertainment.

Thumbs up if you own more than 1,000 shares of AMC; thumbs down if less.

Shares gonna be recalled by lenders. We are on the verge here. The amount of options in the money is going to be insane.

Look at all of the options in and near the money at $15 it will be game over. Lets do this!

Wait hold up let me get you thinking:

So in the past week we traded estimated 600M+ volume.

Individual investors amc share count is 300M~ not including insiders and institution.

Even if HALF sold we traded the whole float already.

Now think of all the shares we been holding before last week since January and previous owners before squeeze that haven't sold.

I'm estimating that we are holding anywhere from 5-10x of the float.

I'll hold all year to be a millionaire. No other stocks that I know will make me as much as this stock. HODL, we got all the DD we need. We are going to make history!

We are 💎 hands.

The share price doesn't matter. We all know the squeeze is inevitable at this point. Ortex has indicated a squeeze is coming. Ihors has given AMC a squeeze score of 10/10. It's inevitable. We just buy, hold and wait. It will happen.

1.4 million shares borrowed so far to fight against us. We need some volume in regular hours. Shorts are hanging back to really attack I would think at open.

The goal for them might be just to drive us down and then trade it sideways all day. We have done a great job of applying buy pressure to fight them the last 2 extremely tough days. We will be up for the task today.

Like many of you, I've spent an inoridinate amount of time lately running scenarios and pondering ways to retain and bolster as much of my soon-to-be-realized gains on AMC for years to come. Not financial advice but like I'm sure many, I plan to park a good chunk of cash in dividend stocks and low-load funds that spin off yearly yields of 4 and 5 percent or greater. You can figure this at any investment or yield percentage, but if you are new to investing and thinking conservatively, consider this...

$1,000,000 reinvested @ 4.5% = $45,000 annual dividend income. :)

Never had so many people I didn't know been so concerned about my money.

Well I am happy with my 15k of shares, not worried if it goes down today because I like this company, I see your manipulation, and I have faith that soon enough your world will be coming crashing down upon you for your abuse.

I am loaded up for another deal as they say "buy low sell high"!

HF’s will try everything to shake us, including tank the price leading up to June 2..Every share we sell to them is 1 less synthetic in the count. And im pretty sure they only count the settled shares, so all shares purchased within 3 business days of the start of the vote wont be included.. We need to hold until June 2 no matter what. We have to expose the true share count to really get this moving.

Good Morning AMC Apes— The squeeze is around the corner. Stick together. Buy more if you can and don’t sell. I’ll be buying more today and not just the dips. I’ll buy at the Ask.

There not covering there shorts it’s all FUD there is about 6 billion or more fake shares, OVER 6 million failures to deliver maybe even more and all are working to spread FUD to get you to sell out your position DD we are winning we get Above14.50 and we will see dollar’s move not pennies . This is not financial advise take it with a grain of salt I’m not selling

who would you believe a guy that comes to a stock board to comment negativity at 4am Est constantly trying to persuade you sell or a share holder telling you the whole market is red breath and trust the decision you made when you bought amc !
##############################
##############################
We are 4 million strong, we own 5 times the float hypothetically. Start spending some money on OTM calls. When you do this you force brokers to buy shares to potentially cover those calls. We have to push the issue. Laying back is going to lead to people moving on and that is what the hedgie is hoping.

Near term options might cost a few bucks but it adds unwanted pressure to the hedgie. Just look up GAMMA SQUEEZE. Why do you think June 18th options are so volatile right now? June 18th keeps options keep getting written about.

Its time to go on the offensive and force the issue even if it costs us a few bucks
##############################
##############################
Retail holds about 80% of the float - strong hands. The high volume is because of synthetic artificial shares being shorted by Hedge funds. Their tactics are digging a deeper hole for them. They will capitulate sooner or later. 💎 hands!

Notice that every single time a basher makes a doom and gloom prediction, they never include a reason why. At least when we post something about going up, we have many reasons why we believe. Another thing, they never talk about FTD's. They want to hide the fact that the hedge funds owe us so many shares. Obviously this is because they know that when the hedges finally have to return the shares, it's all over for them and the SP will rocket. Today's price is absolutely, 100 percent NOT a reflection of the true value of this stock.

IF the squeeze never goes through, the stock is going to be $30 or more naturally once all the games and HF tactics end.... which will end eventually. The way I see it, I stand to double my money at the minimum. That’s a 100% gain..... squeeze or no squeeze, that’s a good return with little risk IMO.

SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT
Yesterday’s crash in the entire market was staged with Bitcoin and Etherium driving down prices. Some say the Hedged Funds are liquidating their stocks to help cover the upcoming mega squeeze and some institutions are buying. The SHORTS have lost close to a billion dollars on the recent increase in share price. If the number of synthetic shares is as high as they say, than this is going to be the MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES.

AMC brings new drama to the stock market - 18th of May 2021 by ORTEX
It’s a script worthy of any blockbuster sequel. Following the David versus Goliath story of GameStop from earlier this year, retail investors are once again setting their sights on heavily shorted stocks and the hedge funds that hold those positions.
In January of this year, the world was enthralled by the GameStop saga as retail investors drove the value of GME upwards by more than 700 per cent in a single week, leading to a short squeeze – a phenomenon where short sellers are caught out by a sudden increase in the share price and have to buy back shares to cover their positions.
At the time, AMC was only a supporting act, but it is now back with a vengeance and has a leading role of its own.
The value of AMC stock rose almost 20 per cent yesterday, closing at $15.49 a share, its highest closing price since February 1st. ORTEX data shows that, as a result of these price increases, short sellers are down $503m on AMC positions over the past five trading days, with $210m of these losses coming in yesterday’s session.
However, this is still some way away from the scale of losses seen on GameStop short positions which, according to ORTEX data, now amount to almost $12bn year to date, with $426m of these losses coming in the past five trading days.
The prospect of the short squeeze on both stocks was highlighted by Ortex Analytics’ proprietary trading signals, helping our users to ensure they were correctly positioned ahead of yesterday’s events.
But just like in any good story, there are likely to be twists and turns along the way, and a fightback from the short sellers is to be expected. Our data is already showing a decrease in short positions over recent days, but this is starting from an already very high exposure. As of today, 21.8% of GME’s freefloat and 18.3% of AMC’s freefloat are held in short positions, indicating there is still plenty of room for retail investors to hurt the short sellers. This sequel could well turn out to be a blockbuster in its own rights.

$AAPL has over two TRILLION in market cap. Do you even realize how much new money would have to flow into AAPL just to get it to rise 5%? That’s right, over a Hundred Billion dollars! Meanwhile, $AMC has only 6.5 billion TOTAL market cap and they are about to open up in a major way, and the longs have the over leveraged shorts backed up against a wall. The SAME amount of new money, $100 billion, would drive AMC’s stock up 1500%! The only question you have to ask yourself is this.. do you like merely keeping the money you have? Or do you like making money?

AMC investors. I know that you have heard this many times but we need to be patient and continue buying when affordable to do so.

This is a psychological game and hedge funds are banking on investors losing hope as they send in paid shills to try to break your spirits while they are illegally manipulating the stock.

At every opportunity, investors need to get the message out that we are aware of the corruption and let others know what hedge funds are doing and how.

Take screen shots of anything that you notice or see that is evidence of their wrongdoing. You never know when that information might be needed.

Let’s all remember that GME went through the exact same phases. All they did was buy and hold and buy more. That’s all we have to do. GME run up began in August and Squeezed end of December, early January, in 5 months. AMC run up began in January, and now it’s the 5th month. We don’t need any catalyst, just buy and hold and buy more. Nonetheless, some information on how many shares currently outstanding will certainly play as a catalyst and the SEC will be forced to take some action or their credibility worldwide will be ruined forever. So those people saying the June share recount, even if it’s not the full or final count, is not going to help, you’re mistaken. When AA announces there’s more shares outstanding than they’ve legally distributed, the SEC will be forced to take action to cover themselves and their integrity worldwide.

GME ran up to 15+ on October 19th, the pulled back back to 9-10 range by October 26th, then slowly began going up again and finally squeezed at the end of December. Point of the post, the ups and downs will happen, this may even drop back down to the 9’s again. Patience. HF’s can’t just lay interest forever, it’s not their money they’re losing, it’s their investors. This may even take another 2 months from here until July, but patience will pay, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, you don’t want to miss it.

ICC-2021-007 PASSED & APPROVED TODAY !!!!!
ICC-007 has been approved today:



This is bigger than ICC-005. This updates margin requirements hedge funds must put up required by brokers to maintain their positions in a trading account, and now the margin requirement can be increased immediately based on the volatility, price fluctuations with their assets (increasing risks in the market, such as risks shorting AMC/GME). These increasing risks could include a predictable short squeeze coming soon.

Mediators between banks and hedge funds are getting wary of the immensely high risks these hedge funds are posing to them.

Based on this ruling, if the account's updated margin (haircut) exceeds the account's capital, the broker can either margin call them or force liquidate their positions until the margin no longer exceeds the capital.

This ruling updates the collateral required for these overleveraged positions, basically they are further mitigating risks, in addition to what they put in ICC-005. Looks like regulators really aren't having it anymore.

They acknowledge in this filing that volatility may be extreme in the near future, and they do not want to be caught holding the bag.

In summary, ICC-007 ensures that even in stressed market conditions, the ICC will continue to collect sufficient collateral from its members and that such collateral could be liquidated in a timely manner to meet financial obligations as a central counterparty (mediator between banks and hedge funds).

ICC-005 was passed and approved just 3 days ago. Now ICC-007 got passed and approved today. Things are moving much quicker than I anticipated.

AMC GME. We r one big family.
##############################
##############################
IMHO, GME squeeze was just a sample run and serves as the playbook for what AMC will do. Now that accounts moved on from RH and people learned their lesson on conducting business with thieves, there shouldn't be much in the way from reaching 1000 SP. High odds we crash the market too.

Facebook deleted the AMC group I was in, 20,000 strong. I have a personal circle of 23 people and growing that I keep updated on news and tidbits, doing my DD. Seems Citadel is a major investor of Facebook, so hopefully we all do our best to keep each other up, and hold through ALL the coming shenanigans.

23k wall at 13.80
56k wall at 14.

They really don't want us to go pass 14 during hours. Buy the ASK.
##############################
##############################
HF's are really desperate to hold this at 14. If anyone out there knows how to trace level 2, please find out who is sending these synths, this is extremely illegal. No one should get to cheat this much and get away with it. In pre, they are walling 1000 buys with 8000 sells, how desperate are they? Probability for whoever is doing this will be a nasty one, stop now while you can.

If someone said to you, “ hey you have the potential to make life changing money this year, all you need to do is buy and hold this stock, buy more when you can and hold until you’re paid.”

What would you do... buy and hold
Obviously.

Do not get discouraged or too emotional about the price at this point. It’s irrelevant.

Facts are;
- we the retail investors alone hold the float we own it.
- they naked shorted this more times than they can keep tracks
- there will Be catalysts coming
- we are a very rare and uncommon and new situation.... THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

Millions of regular hard working people who have heart and care about more than just money. But equality and fairness in our world.

Hold not just for the moon, hold for change in a world that desperately needs it.

Apes great work so far holding great consolidation , Monday I am loading up , reading all the Doc's etc I have no idea when this will squeeze, it is a recoiled spring loaded, it can happen any moment really.

APES 🦍, own all the stock already , it is way oversold, plus all the synthetics.

3.2 milion share holders was only USA,Canada.that was before every body else. Jumped on.In Europe it's biggest countries have bought tons of AMC stock Asia too.
we own shares Apes in every corner of the earth,retail still buying big too.

Hedges are ducking and diving , selling off bitcoin etc they know they have to cover they are in panic mode,

The Fed ,Sec know the whole fraud game ,government is working on damage limitation , they do not want to be the fall guys, they are making new laws to protect them selves , theses inadvertently fall in our favour yes , it is to ensure the hedges involved the most, are hung out to dry , it's fairly complex that's why the new rules are being made air tight.

Hedges will be burned we will win they have beligerantally overstepped the mark this time , the USA economy has been pushed to the breaking point , it's on a cliff edge.

Fed cannot allow the total economy to crash hence the new rules being rushed in to protect them , which actually helps us retail stock owners.

The daily graphs may look nice , but that's a fake mask , as the stock is way oversold, the graph is manipulated they have paid fines for this before as well.
This is nothing new .But behind the graph the are bleeding money we have to see past the graph.

Hmm let's look , how..
Easy way they can trick a graph when stock is sold for 12.50 the can register it at the other end with their buddies fractionally for say 12.499999.

Lots of these sales even though they are buys make the graph go down , instead of up this is a simple example .

check here twitter Check this tweet

Do lots of these while you stop the graph too if you want as well it's optional and you suddenly see a kind red line, so ignore the graph retail APEs are winning .

I love this, it encourages me , shows me their desperation,

Dilemma

Risking the whole USA economy would put the country In turmoil, so feds will ringfence this wild fire 🔥

APE payouts will be huge , if everyone holds , diamond hands.

I expect shares will be transformed for compensation , in the regions of 2000 , 6000 per share.
Why damage limitation .

Even if one thinks the feds will not step in, hedges bridges are burning as APEs buy and hold interest is going up , banks are asking for their money back as they loaned too much out and are scared of loosing billions , so all hedges can do is sell crypto , and their stocks which is happening as we speak frantically , they are shell shocked they never expected this war.
I did not post articles as I wanted this to be a summary of what I have learned .

My 2 cents I am not a financial advisor
Just a Diamond 💎💎💸💸 handed APE 🦍🦍🦍

Looking to load up on Monday 😜😜😜🤑🤑🤑🤑🍌🍌💎💎🦍💸💎💎💸💰💰💰

It could be worth mentioning that as I type there is a golden cross occurring on today's AMC chart. The current price and 10 day averages as well as the 50 day average have now all crossed up and over the 200 day moving average at a price which Yahoo is showing as $12.37.

##############################
For the new to catch up on the AMC/GME story, here is my 2 cents interpretation of what I see.
The Stock Market is basically a Prey hunting trapping game and as I see it goes like this:
The big guys goes on scavenger hunt and then they zero on a prey target. The company needs to have some interest in their stock. The hunters start to throw foods on the road to attract the prey to dip their toes in the water and have some confidence their shares are growing.
Increasing the share prices would increase investors (prey) attraction to invest more.
Then the hunters ask the Market Manipulators to create huge amount of Put options and Call options to make them gain/loss neutral and cover their tracks.

Then the Hunters lend the synthetic shares they created and the short selling begins not at high volume yet, because the goal is to keep selling as much as investors prey keeps on buying. The Prey collects the sold money to grow even larger and more powerful to replicate the plan with other stocks and continue to repeat the trap.

Once they decide that the prey eat enough shares and trapped, hunters flood the market relentlessly of those synthetic shares that appears legit since it is backed by Option put/call. Certainly, some borrowing of the real shares take place as well as that is also part of the trap cover-up to deceive the prey.

Part of the decoy system are Media Bashers, false news manipulators, buying and selling outside the market “Blackpool” out of shore tradings, fake analysis, bought/bribed regulators and authorities etc.

In short, provide unlimited supply to achieve the target goal of the most favored outcome of driving the company to bankruptcy or at the most to purchase the borrowed and synthetic shares at a much lower rate than the fund collected selling them. Then the regulators may fine the Manipulators a very tinny percentage as a “punishment” which is tinny skin out of the entire prey.

So historically, the smart prey try to interpret charts and fundamentals which basically buys when the enemy is looking the other way or when the enemy is setting the crumbs on the road to trap the prey then as soon the big trap gets closer, sell and sheer the profit.

Another Prey coping tactics has been is to buy options as much as they can afford to lose and for a short chance.

Another prey coping mechanism is that when they get trapped to return bleeding with broken hopes accepting that this time they miscalculated and go on with less goals in life.
However, this time is different. The prey decided to turn into Apes and bond worldwide against their aggressors. Apes now start eating the dangled food the aggressors left on the way with courage. Apes realized all food anywhere can be turned into a hidden trap and cost them to get hunted swiftly and decided to focus on one GME and AMC trap food the aggressors set for them. Now the prey trapped the aggressor not as a form of becoming a new aggressor, but as a duty and a right to defend one’s own life, family and belongings against the aggressors even if it means bankrupting the aggressor and even jailing them as they have committed robing and stealing in the trillion of wealth against the majority of the people of good well everywhere.

Because the aggressors have done it over and over with great success, Apes must tough it out and stand their ground against the aggressor with resolute.

Now, for me as long as the aggressors are covering with new synthetic shares is not the squeeze at all. The real squeeze is when the manufacturers of the synthetic shares are forced to purchase them at any price the seller determined and born those synthetic shares and every borrowed shares there is. Uncovered borrowed share is a naked share that dilute the market and loot investors.

This is my opinion and not any financial advice as all I see is a game of hunting

This is what longs need to know. It was no fluke that last week and yesterday AMC had a major runup in the after market. Usually, this would indicate something was going to be announced. Something BIG, something REALLY BIG. But that is usually, as in most publicly traded stocks. I thought so. But now in hindsight, I can see this was all smoke and mirrors. An elaborate plan to create sellers. Run the price up by buying in the after market (it is so much easier to do, and control, like a controlled burn with a forest fire), then try your best to collapse it the next day. What is the hope? That HODLers will become sellers on the next run up. If I were short forty to sixty million shares (maybe a lot more), I'd sure want to create sellers rather than have this launch forward, causing every vulture on Wall Street to join the fray, and drive me out of business. All I can say is "THE SHOW GOES ON." I AM NOT SELLING ANYTHING! Thumbs up if you are on board and want to keep this active for all our long friends to see.

I don't know what to post anymore. I post positive and facts and its all deleted. I post funny things that have no persuasion on any matter and deleted. These basher's are reporting like crazy or YF is scared because they are short on AMC too probably. This will be deleted or reported I am sure. I guess do we just have to do Morse Code or two cans and a string to communicate?

Message to newer AMC investors.

For starters, I'm a regular guy (Working man) with no formal education in finance. I am simply a guy who has invested in the markets for extra cash for the last 20 years or so. While I cannot say that I know everything there is to know about the markets I can say that AMC investors are in a very unique situation. Mathematically speaking we are set to win this fight against the HF's but we will only accomplish this if we pull up our pants and continue to hold.

Selling your position due to a negative article or basher post (There's tons of them on AMC) will not accomplish your dreams. The negative media and bashers do not have your best interest in mind, so please do not fall for their propaganda. They know their articles and posts are false and that's fine. We as AMC investors can see through it. We must continue to hold as a group. We are a team and teams stick together. I encourage you to not do all of your research on chat boards. There's a ton of information on youtube, google and WAS on FB before being pulled (What does that tell you?) We will win this! It may not be won on Monday or Tuesday but who really cares. We are set to win but must continue to be the tortoise in this race.....

Here's the best analogy I can think of:

AMC- I'm willing to give you $1000-$100,000,000. Do you want it?

Investor- Yes

AMC- Great, can you wait a week, month or year to receive it?

Investor- I'll wait as long as it takes.

Nothing in life is easy and remember "If it's easy, then it's sleavy" Have a great weekend APES and I'll see you Monday!!

I am new to all this AMC I just purchased 300 shares it’s not much but can someone explain how this can get to 1000 when game stop ￼ highest was in the mid 400s what makes this stock better than game stop. ￼Thank you
##############################
##############################
Worth remember that if we could only close at 15.01 or better today, a gamma squeeze would follow. Look at the In The Money calls... We'd see $20 or higher on Monday, the rest of the week would make history because the squeeze would be on...

GOOODmorning, How many people can we rally up to day ?!?! WE APES need to start buying today and drive op the price! If we can get this baby above the 13.50 a HUGE amount of options will expire in the money !!

THIS IS ALL YOU APES NEED TO KNOW

Im not a financial advisor but I want to let everyone know that I’ve been here since February and I can 1000% guarantee you that we bought the 450 Million float at least 3 to 4 times. We own over 1.5 Billion shares right now and that number is not going down but up. They lost and they know. They will eventually need to buy back those shares from us, hence the short squeeze.

Trust me when I say that what happens in a 75 Trillion dollars worth stock market is never a “coincidence”.

All the events (FUD articles/New laws) we’ve seen in the last months are planned and are happening for damage control. The SEC is not closing their eyes on this whole situation. They might even be working hand in hand with the Hedgefunds to make sure that when that day happens they wont crash the whole economy.

At this point, up or down doesn’t change ANYTHING. All that is important is HOLD till it happens because it WILL happen.

The important word in this whole fiasco is INEVITABLE.

We are way more than 3.2 Million apes. WAYYYY MORE.

See you on the moon my beautiful family.

Love y’all and trust the process

Good post from AMC holders
Was your resolve tested or strengthened today? Make no mistake, AMC was under attacked today. It was a tough battle but we prevailed! We wanted 14.01. We got 14.03! They tried to fake us out with the fake news articles and the fake sell off and we came out on top! Let's keep it going! Here's some things to remember going forward when you see hit pieces like we saw today:

- AMC raised 2 billion dollars, giving them more liquidity than ever in their 101 year history.
- AMC is the largest Movie theater chain...wait for it...in the World!
- AMC sells more tickets than all of professional sports combined. (That's alot!)
- There are 493 million legitimate shares of AMC and it is believed that short sellers have created over 1 billion(possibly significantly more) synthetic shares of AMC.
- Retail investors(us) own nearly 100% of the free float(493 million shares) and are continuing to purchase the synthetic shares that are being created by short sellers.
-This is a big one...ALL SYNTHETIC SHARES MUST BE BOUGHT BACK BY SHORT SELLERS.
-As of march there were over 3 million retail investors holding shares of AMC and it is likely that number has grown significantly since then.
-Today 5/18/21 was the 8th straight green day in a row for AMC

The SQUEEZE is inevitable. US original apes have been holding before January and will hold AMC to ground floor PT 100k. This will be bigger than GMEs 480

AMC is volatile to the extreme. If you are impatient , have an unstable mind, emotional, you will NOT survive .

AMC retail own over 80% of outstanding shares. Meaning, we SET THE PRICE of the squeeze. LONGER YOU HOLD, THE MORE YOU WILL GAIN . See yall at 100k.

Again, if you ARE IMPATIENT, emotional, complain about price drops THIS stock is not for you.

Im just a simple minded Diamond Handed APE.

THE DATA is there; the DD is there. There are over 2 BILLION synthetic shares that Citadel has been using to try and short AMC.

"The Annual Meeting has been rescheduled for July 29, 2021, and a new record date of June 2, 2021, has been established for stockholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting. The Company will deliver a new notice of the Annual Meeting to stockholders as of the record date, who will need to resubmit their votes, even if they have previously voted. Also, AA has said even if you dont vote, your vote will go towards the majority of which is in the lead between Yes or No. Meaning, If more people voted No, and you didn't vote, your vote will be counted as No. Vice versa."

"In early June, we will send a new proxy and voting materials to those owning AMC stock on June 2. It’s a brand new election, starting over completely afresh. Any votes for the May 4 meeting get ignored.”

HODL AND BUY

TWO MOST SIMPLEST THINGS YOU CAN DO IN YOUR LIFE

Crypto is disintegrating rapidly, Mark Cuban says over leveraged people or companies getting called.

Could this be one of our AMC short hedge funds? I never thought about that possibility, but it would be a coup if its hedgies who are getting called on crypto.

Whatever is going on in crypto is a sure sign that the market payoff is coming.

Something really really interesting is going on right now.

My fear is this, if the amount of loss in the crypto market spills into the US financial markets its going to be a total bloodbath for millions on top of millions of Americans, and we would be in 1929 mode once again.

Is this a sign to come. We are on the right side of the trade, but these hedge funds are going to cause financial ruin for many average everyday citizens who are not on the right side of the trade.

I for one do believe what is going on in crypto is coming to the markets soon.

At this point The HF’s, MM, SEC, and BANKS know a collapse is coming and nobody wants to be responsible for causing it. The catalyst for it all will be when the repo market taps out at 500bil, then Banks will need funds to make their SLR and the only way to get it will be to Margin Call their HF buddies. Banks seem like they have been trying to give their buddies and good friends some time but the bomb is ticking, and we all know there is no honor amongst thieves

NYSE , LLC; Notice of Filing and immediate Effectiveness of proposed Rule Change to “CONTINUE Offering Certain Connectivity Services (Dark Fiber Data feeds to re- route our buy orders that were disconnected last week by SEC) that have been suspended by the SEC. 05/18/21
In other words, SEC turned back on dark pool data feeds for more price manipulation!!! OMG OMG

2)There are nearly 14 million ITM $14 calls set to expire this Friday 05/21/21

3)New Liquidity requirements 05/19/21 tomorrow
New rule in effect tomorrow which requires more assets on hand to meet daily margin risk requirements
4) SR-ICC -2021-007 “ Liquidation and Haircuts”
ICC is a Derivative Clearing Organization which operates as a central counterparts and clearing house for Credit Default Swap (CDS) transactions conducted by its participants. ICC ensures that, even in MOASS or stressed market conditions, it will continue to collect sufficient collateral from its clearing participants and that such collateral could be LIQUIDATED to meet its financial obligations
This will be implemented/ posted tomorrow 05/19/21
5) OCC :done some stress test recently /increased clearing fund /
BOK / JP Morgan / Goldman Sachs among many others recently sold tons of bonds to raise a record level of cash in billions . Why ? They are ready to buy assets of defaulting members at an asset auction.

So be patient. And continue to buy and hold

Guys I'm seeing some posts on here saying to sell at $20 or $30. The bashers are on here with a new tactic: to try to get you to sell early. DO NOT. Guys, this is a chance to make wealth that will last a generation, an opportunity to be the largest transfer of wealth society has ever seen. Why imho on earth would you sell AMC at 20 or 30? Guys, I'm holding for you, and you're holding for me. We control the stock price together. The HFs manipulation can only continue for so much longer. But it's so important that all apes are on the same page of setting the ceiling high, not letting them get off easy. I truly have faith in all or you that you will hold, so we will see the largest transfer of wealth in modern society. Then, we can all retire early and relax! Go AMC!

$amc $gme IT BEGINS! BTIG CHARGED FOR NAKED SHORTING! It has been said, by an insider, that the stocks that were naked shorted were amc and gamestop! According to the SEC’s complaint, from December 2016 through July 2017, BTIG mismarked as “long” or “short exempt” over 90 sale orders from a single hedge fund customer – totaling more than $250 million in sale orders and comprising nearly 160 million shares of stock. This is in violation of Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO.

BTIG’s customer was not deemed to own the shares of stock sold, because the Hedge Fund: (i) did not have title to the stock; (ii) had not purchased or entered into an unconditional contract binding on both parties thereto to purchase the stock; (iii) did not own a security convertible into the stock that it had tendered for conversion; and (iv) did not have a net long position in the stock. BTIG’s customer was, therefore, “short,” and BTIG should have correctly marked its customer’s sale orders as “short.”

Most apes know this already. For those new. Once this gets into the 20s, Citadel and other price manipulators will sell off in bulk their shares to drive the price down. That is when all the fake longs and bashers will be out in full force to push a panic sell.
We are smarter than them. We have beat them for 5 months. None of us is selling our stakes in this gold mine for pennies. Don't be phased by these manipulated dips no matter how high the price gets. Just hold and buy the dips if you can, it will jump up again fast and furious after each dip.
##############################
##############################
Fully expect to see this get pushed back down to 14.25 today so those short can buy calls to cover...i think we have seen this pattern for a few days....selling/buying calls. Classic trades to get out of a short.

When it pops we should see $16+ with a retrace to $15.50, then another push... I believe $22 is reasonable.

fyi, I am a former equity and options trader.

They are trying to manipulate the stock back to a place where it looks like there is no major short issue, and that they have full control of the situation, just remember the common sense maths tells us that there is a monumental hidden issue which they will ultimately have to account for. Just hold and we will find out just how big it is.

Could the Squeeze be on for AMC again?

Over the past month, shares of AMC Entertainment (AMC) have traded in a relatively narrow band around $10 per share. In recent days, though, we’ve seen AMC surge on retail interest, the likes of which we haven’t seen since early this year.

That’s right folks, it looks like the short squeeze is back on.

It’s a retail investor’s market out there today, and retail investors are certainly having their day in the sunshine.

Short selling was an important part of the market before some good too greedy with it. They realized they could make more money, faster by shorting a company and then using their considerable funds and influence to manipulate the market. The pandemic offered an opportunity to kick that behaviour into overdrive and really line their pockets. What they didn’t expect when they over leveraged themselves that individuals would band together to call them on their irresponsible practices. Now they’re stuck but their egos won’t let them concede that they got called on it and lost. Instead they continue to lose billions doubling down in hopes that the masses will give up or the government will give out. Unfortunately for them, they’ve now exposed the malpractices of short selling and there will surely be more and more regulation and restrictions when it comes to the practice of short selling. They know the party is over and that’s why shorting has been so prevalent the last few months. It’s why these short selling bashes come in here to cry and complain, because they understand that the Reddit movement has shined a light on these practices and that will eventually lead to tighter regulations in this space.

##############################
All the new (43 million) AMC shares and the recently sold Wanda shares need to slowly consolidate into Ape hands and/or long institutional hands. The key word is "consolidate" -- unless those shares end up in diamond hands, there will be no squeeze.

This means we have to keep buying...and stay patient. I honestly don't see a squeeze happening before the end of summer or early fall.

All the summer blockbuster will hopefully act as mini-catalysts along the way.

I am long -- and still hopeful on a squeeze -- but know that a squeeze is not imminent.

This is not FUD -- but an anti-impatience post.
