DOW gains 0.54%. TELL gains 5.34% on HEAVY volume (234% of ave. TELL vol.) In my estimation, this qualifies as a VERY GOOD DAY.

Assuming the stock has a temporally little downfall with much higher than normal volume because of Total selling off and giving path to other big investors to be announced.

Another great pre market jump. Hopefully smash $3.20 today. just need to sustain the SP so it does not drop.
A lot of interest growing in this stock. Happy days!

There are a lot of sellers above $2.85. It would be to hold above that level today and close somewhere between $2.86 and $3.00.

There are more old shorters hanging around here, some are not much active now as they've crowled back under their rocks.

This what happened this morning: On the spike up, the stock screeners picked up on the move and got attention. Some large money came in with a high volume of orders to bid it down. They then purchased a large order at the lower price point. TELL is getting noticed. The short squeeze might be approaching if not already happening. The news may be creeping out prior to public news. You may be running into your last chance for a retirement element in your portfolio. All strong portfolios should have retirement elements and TELL is one of them. Most debt free energy companies pay dividends. I fully expect TELL will also. It is very likely. All my natgas stock pay large dividends. It helps with their taxes and keeps a strong shareholder base.

If you are thinking about investing in TELL, it's a great idea. You are safe buying at these levels because the share price will always come back to here on any dips, but there's more. Once TELL breaks ground on the new well, the new safe level will become around $5 and once they complete driftwood, $10 will be the new safe level at least and probably more likely $15. For now, you are totally safe to buy TELL here and always buy the dips if you can.

TELL is one of the few remaining stocks in recovery phase. The catalyst here is that they are coming out of the pandemic drop while also engaging in their new international project of liquid gas export. They have a unique model in that they are leading in liquid gas export as well as having local compressed gas. Part and parcel to their project is the new 4 port docking for tankers. All that is the catalyst going forward. Coming out of pandemic combine with the new massive international export project makes them a long term hold for massive equity gains. One more thing to remember; Tell is debt free and most debt free energy companies pay dividends. I fully expect a dividend once the Driftwood project is completed. So you are getting a first floor opportunity to build massive equity as well as the likelihood of a dividend on that huge equity. This structure makes TELL a retirement element for your portfolio. Buy here and then reap rewards for the next 15 to 20 years. But wait! There's more! TELL will be going into carbon capture and in so doing, they will gain further profit from feeding the carbon into duel cell power storage for the grid and this makes them a green energy company. At that stage, they will qualify for government relationships in that regard. It is all good and green from here.

If I have not inundated you with enough facts, there is another that you must be aware of: There is a short squeeze coming if it hasn't already quietly started. You definitely want to be on this ride during the short squeeze. Buy now, buy all dips, and hold for 5 years minimum. You will be incredibly happy, but I think you will want this for 15 to 20 years minimum. When they go carbon capture, change that to a lifetime hold with dividend. Look at the TELL management, and you will see this is a top tier team with high integrity and great business acumen. The integrity, experience, and business acumen of the TELL team is second to none. This is a no lose investment, but it requires patience for the systematic steps to take their place in the process. Most people chase success, but the real rewards are obtained by placing yourself where success will arrive. Success is already filing into TELL with a lot more to come.

The pullback makes sense. Look at it as if the high for the day was around $2.7. $2.55 would be a good time to get back in/pick up some shares. The fact that it hit $3 is insane, but gives me confidence in the possibility that we will see north of $3 sooner rather than later.

Tellurian: Your LNG Lottery Ticket

Summary

- The LNG market is growing at a rate that supply cannot keep up to. Something has to happen and quickly.

- Tellurian has a shot to join the party if they can get the proper funding for their $17 billion Driftwood LNG project.

- Tellurian stock's life depends on this project getting off the ground. Things could get really ugly if it falls through or Total backs out.

I said buy the dips yesterday if you needed more shares, and now you see why. Definitely in a bullish pattern now and for good reason; about to break ground and go international exports. Debt free, international exporter with mixed model of compressed and liquid gas, 4 port shipping docks, in a double decade natural gas bull market with additional income from carbon capture duel cell power grid support. All upside, no downside. Get real and get long!

TELL up in the green three, or is it four, days in a row amidst heavy broad market selling. Even today with a 35 point drop on S&P, TELL is bouncing up another $0.03 in after hours following a $0.05 rise at the close. I imagine there will be a pull back sometime, but maybe the shorts are getting off slowly now. Perhaps they are slowly exiting and going long. Only the smart ones will go long, but we still have the short squeeze and soon TELL will be supplying for the international market. This is not only awesome, but super awesome. They will have a four port shipping dock supplying liquid for international markets. This is a very special delivery of an increasingly high demand product and all built with income from production.

TELL now has more buyers knocking at their door than even t hey can fully supply. The entire industry is running in short supply and especially, liquid. As a debt free company, TELL will be so flush with cash that they will be able to continue building to meet the growing demand and do so without bank loans. I would like to see them take on a conservative low interest loan to increase their speed of development. However, perhaps that simply would not help. Construction has a timeline, and it may very well be that their cash flow is able to keep up with construction and then some. It's all onward and upward from here. It's all just a matter of logistics which is why TELL said to be patient because it is all happening now. Now the time frames will allow the structure of the design. As I said, this is a retirement stock to hold for 15 years and longer. We'll re-evaluate in 15 years, but for now, it's time to build an international liquified gas delivery beast.

I know I am repeating, but it is worth restating that shares price will always come back to these levels. The strategy here is a no lose opportunity. You can buy here and if fortunate to get a dip, buy into the dips. There is no way that share price will not come back to these levels on any dip. All data is favoring TELL at this point. Debt free, rising gas prices, and a plethora of buyers knocking at their door and waiting in the wings for product delivery. TELL has been open about all processes, and now they are solidifying the contractual details for delivery to their international customers. TELL is being very precise and very systematic and very responsible. TELL is a top level company when it comes to capability, integrity, and responsibility. The TELL management team is world-class and second to none.

And in the not good news department - The world‚Äôs top exporter of liquefied natural gas Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. It‚Äôs also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively. U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably won‚Äôt secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF. Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatar‚Äôs wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

PRESS RELEASE | Oct√°vio Sim√µes Appointed Chairman of the U.S. Chamber‚Äôs U.S.-Korea Business Council
WASHINGTON, D.C.‚Äî The U.S. Chamber‚Äôs U.S.-Korea Business Council (USKBC) announced today that Oct√°vio Sim√µes, president and chief executive officer of Tellurian Inc., has been elected chairman of the USKBC for a two-year term (2021-2022).

The USKBC is comprised of leading U.S. companies operating in Korea and is the primary U.S.-based business organization promoting strong economic ties between the two countries. The USKBC ensures that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement continues to deliver benefits to both economies and works to promote policies that support expanded bilateral trade and investment, innovation, and private sector-driven growth in both economies.

‚ÄúThe USKBC has continued to play a vital role in promoting a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship between our two countries,‚Äù Sim√µes said. ‚ÄúThere are many opportunities to further the U.S.-Korea partnership and areas to explore for expanded cooperation ‚Äì including public-private collaboration on the COVID-19 response; energy transition and climate; digital transformation; and supply chain resiliency. I look forward to driving progress in the USKBC‚Äôs advocacy agenda, and to being of service to both the U.S. and Korean business communities in promoting a strong bilateral commercial relationship.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is delighted to welcome Oct√°vio Sim√µes, president and CEO of Tellurian Inc., as the USKBC‚Äôs new chairman. We look forward to working with him to strengthen the U.S.-Korea economic and commercial relationship,‚Äù said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of International Affairs at the U.S. Chamber. ‚ÄúOct√°vio brings a wealth of leadership, insight, and vision to his role as incoming USKBC chairman. His management and international business development experience and knowledge of the Korean market will play a pivotal role as he leads the Council‚Äôs advocacy agenda to enhance economic opportunities for U.S. companies.‚Äù

Total will make a $500 million equity investment in the Driftwood project, according to press releases from the companies. Total also has agreed to purchase 1 mtpa of LNG from Driftwood, and the companies will enter into another agreement for an additional 1.5 mtpa of LNG from Tellurian Marketing‚Äôs LNG offtake volumes from Driftwood, per the releases.

Additionally, Total will pay $200 million to purchase approximately 19.87 million shares of Tellurian common stock. Total first bought $207 million worth of Tellurian shares in 2017, so the latest deals bring Total's combined investment in the Tellurian portfolio to $907 million, per the releases.
=======================================================================================

So I was off by just a bit. They were planning on acquiring additional 20 million shares on top of original 46 million and pay $200 million for it, so $407 million for 66 million shares. Instead, Total sold down its stake and has become a less than 5% investor now ................

Until TELL can find a price level that supports the stock, further price depreciation is probable. Momentum is negative. Wait for accumulation indicators to turn positive as a sign that demand for the stock is improving.The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days, indicating that TELL is under accumulation. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of TELL. TELL could find secondary support at its rising 200-day moving average.

Remember all the times you sold a good stock because someone in a forum said some vague, ambiguous, or erroneous information? Then later the company soared, and in your regret for selling, you wondered why you didn't just believe yourself? Those voices in the forum were from a group of paid stock bashers.

The other thing that happens, and could be starting to happen here, is large investors place a series of bids at lower and lower prices which causes stops to be hit, then, at the bottom, they rush in and buy a huge position.

The way I have become very profitable is to buy dips, accumulate shares, and wait for the company to grow. Company growth nullifies all negative news and any attempt to manipulate to the downside. By listening to the CEO, accumulating shares, I have made a huge profit on numerous companies. Buying at lower levels is obviously the key. Buy low, sell high never goes out of style. But you will have to ignore liars who try to trash talk good companies.
##############################
##############################
Just wait until the shorts are panicking, and the investors are having FOMO. I have experienced this as a long several times in the last 18 months, and it is the most rewarding, most fun, most awesome experience. No matter what, TELL will always come back to these levels on any dip and upon digging and supplying to the international market, will be much higher, so you are in a no lose investment from here in any event.

Souki also confirmed talking with 4-5 LNG buyers in phone interview with S&P Global Platts.

"In a telephone interview with S&P Global Platts after the conference, Souki said Tellurian was in advanced talks with four or five LNG buyers for volumes that Tellurian is marketing on its own, not volumes that would be covered by equity partners the company has been soliciting."

That's according to a new survey by the San Francisco-based think tank Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and the independent organisation Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), which suggests China commissioned 38.4GW of new coal plants last year. That translates to more than one large coal plant every week.Feb 4, 2021
China is currently using coal for 58% of their electricity. Seems like such an easy step to go to LNG.
China has not taken a delivery from the US in over a year. Be nice if we had some leadership in this country that promoted LNG as a much cleaner alternative.

Lies. Total is not selling. This is an old event and Total sold because they were in need of money, not because of TELL.

Trash troll spreading fear on old news from the past. Trying to spread fear on a mere 8.5 millions shares sold in March. Then implying they were sold for some negative reason. The seller "Total" sold shares because they themselves were in need of money, not because TELL had any problem. This is what trash trolls do; they cause you to make assumptions on erroneous news, then doubt yourself, and make mistakes. Notice the trash troll said they are selling . . ., but they are not. This is a typical misrepresentation. . . Meg Gentle was replaced with a more experienced CEO. Meg was hired as a placeholder so to meet corporate requirements until the proper CEO could enter the position. It was a courtesy.

As you can see, the trolls wait for price to rise, short, then enter with fake news. It's the most common tactic. If shorting were banned, it would all stop and these parasites would not be able to harm good companies.

TELL will be digging soon, and international contracts are being detailed at this very moment.

Who can explain the effect upcoming $200 M share dilution on TELL valuation? WooskpB, Kristof, Godzilla, anyone? In jan, they had 330 M shares outstanding and at $4 piece, the valuation was about 1.3 billion at revenues of $38 M annually. If the share count goes to 500 M, what revenues do they need to support a price of $5 or $10? i.e. market cap of $2.5 or $5 Billion?

For comparison, Cheniere has revs of $10 B, debt of $31 B (less cash) and # of shares at 250 M or so, with resulting market cap of 20 Billion at $80 share price. If Tellurian's revenues went up to about 200 M by end of next year, what kind of share price would that support with 500 Million shares outstanding?

TELL is up in a massive broad market selloff. I said to buy TELL on the dips; now you see why. But you know what, it's still a great purchase right now for long-term holding. And when the dividend arrives, it's a 20-year hold at least. With carbon capture technology employed, it's a lifelong holder.

Souki talked today at the Global Energy Conference. This got attention so now comes the big money and soon the retirement funds, CalPERS, etc. Wait until the short squeeze. You definitely want to have TELL when the short squeeze happens because it makes for a fun ride up. Remember to put your shares for sale at $20 or more, so the shorts can't get to them when they try to cover buy.

Tellurian Executive Chairman and co-founder Charif Souki today spoke at the Citi Energy & Utilities Virtual Conference. Amid a flurry of questions sent in from retail investors, presumably some of them from the Tellionaire Trading Group, Souki provided some tantalising insights into his expectations for what is in store for his company. 
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWhere do you see Tellurian in 5 years?‚Äù ‚ÄúI expect $7 of cash flow per share. You decide what the multiple is!‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Driftwood construction to start this summer and FID expected Q1 2022
‚Ä¢ Commercial agreements to be finalised and announced ‚Äúin the next few weeks‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúExpect that we will have an announcement to make pretty quickly.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúA lot of expenses we won‚Äôt have this time‚Äù as a result of being an integrated player
‚Ä¢ Expecting to sell 12-15mtpa just in the next few weeks
‚Ä¢ Souki is not worried about inflation impact on the building costs. He said it is not going to be significant as the contingency cost is +5% of the contract: ‚ÄúThe contract is rock solid.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWe know everybody in this business.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be sold out. I have no doubt.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe next seven months are going to be fascinating! Stay tuned.‚Äù

I would love to see this north of $5 by mid July!

As I continue to assert, TELL share price will always come back to these levels. So buying here is totally safe and buying any dips is totally profitable on the return. Buy and hold with confidence at these levels. Consider that TELL will eventually rise and let's consider $5.00 to be the minimum. $5 is not my prediction as a top, but a minimum for the sake of consideration. I think we are going back to $10, then $15, and even higher over time. But some believe $40 and higher, but just consider that from here, even the ridiculously small $5 will still more than 2X your gains easily in the early stage of the build. This will probably happen starting after 2 months of market validity and then toward the second half of this year.

To all longs: The market is full of what we call "traders". They attempt to ride the coattails of us during the day and sell off at closing or in after hours. This is, in part, what causes the fluctuations. Ignore the fluctuations and recognize the slow and steady growth driven by positive facts. I have made hundreds and thousands of dollars buying dips on awesome up and coming companies like TELL. Be they start-ups or recovering, I have made some fine picks. Notice that we had a very red day. S&P down 90 points; the kind of day that could drag the best of stocks down. TELL rose 6 points higher during the middle of the broad market sell. This comes in the wake of the Global Energy meet where Souki presented favorably. You should now see that TELL demonstrated strength amidst a massive broad market sell-off. This indicates what? While there are no 100% short term guarantees, it should be obvious that a new paradigm is unfolding to the upside for TELL's success in their projects. The overall market will have its undulations which will created the vibration in all stocks. TELL has entered a growth phase. That makes investing easy. Just lock on, ignore the vibrations, and focus on the smooth long-term slide up and to the right. Now you can go outside and enjoy life. That is what I do. I make a lot of money picking correctly, averaging in, and then spending most of my time enjoying life away from the screen. That is what I love about the perfect growth stock like TELL. Another bit of advice that has made me successful is that I listen to the CEO and officers inside the companies, not the worthless noise from incompetence on the outside. When you have experience and mastery in an industry like that of Souki and his chosen team, it should be obvious where to place your money. I am all in on TELL now. I added one more small position today, so I think I am very well set for this adventure with TELL. Best to all you longs who have the wisdom and intelligence to think for yourself and do it well. One more thing; I am noticing that as I write this, TELL is up another 2 pennies in after hours. These are often the small indicators that more people are becoming aware that TELL is a gem being polished into a very productive global service and supply company. Like I said, there will be vibrations, but there are also clues. It's up to you to figure out which is which.

I will be in TELL for 5 years or longer. I hope you are on this ride with me for as long.

LNG Kingpin Pursues More Aggressive Strategy

Woospb, how do you not understand how toxic and unlikeable you are? ü§£ü§£ There are plenty of shorts on here. No-one cares that you are short. The way you talk to others, the way you antagonise others, the manner in which you talk about yourself, that is what makes people's skin crawl. You hubris and arrogance knows no bounds. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you do live a normal life and you just need this small aspect of your life to make yourself feel important in some way. But on the of chance your personality on here transfers remotely into the real world, then my deepest condolences go out to anyone who has ever had the misfortune of ever knowing you. You are a deeply troubled man in need of help.

##############################
WoopsB ...question...which stocks do you actually like?
##############################
##############################
It's all a go at this point. We are on our way to $5, then $10, then back to $15, and $20 is not out of the question. TELL cares about investors, so you can expect a dividend after Driftwood. Some who know this industry well are asserting a price of $40 and more. TELL is now a worthy 15-year growth stock. It is, what I have been saying for months, a long term element for a retirement portfolio. You can buy here, buy on dips, even buy higher if you have to wait. Prices will always return here no matter what so buying here is perfectly safe. Debt free company with a demanding international and local market using a mix model of compressed and first liquid gas international exports with 4 port docking for ship transports along with a start-up demand world-wide so high that the industry cannot keep up. This is a no lose situation for TELL and for investors. With carbon limits setting a floor on natural gas which keeps prices high and limits down-side, profits are guaranteed. TELL will also move into their own carbon capture and conversion to hydrogen for fuel cell grid storage. This is all just getting started and is the perfect growth stock for a long hold. Now that these projects are all coming online, consider that there will likely be future projects yet unknown over the course of the double decade bull market in natural gas. With natural gas being the cleanest of the brown gases and the easiest for carbon capture, natural gas can and will become a green energy. If you understand how carbon capture works, you will understand that it returns carbon to hydrogen fuel cell storage for electrical grid backup which reduces the need for coal and even alternative energy. Alternative energy, while a good thing, is difficult to employ. The footprint alone of alternative energy is huge so converting natural gas to a green technology is a big win for companies like TELL. The bottom line is that the debate is over. TELL wins!

Hey guys.. I recommend people get out if they can. Go to a granite rock (preferably dark) and take off your shoes and walk on it or even lie on it bareback. Our bodies are like capacitors. We need to touch the earth and discharge overload by grounding. Jump in a salty see or take a salt bath. the body absorbs more salt this way .. as you know your skin breathes, not just your lungs. Go under the sun or moon, both have good radiation that we need. Turn off all the lies in the media and look around you. Don't let tricksters with power make you think that you are not blessed.
Well, I've been here so long now. My average is just over $1. Its been good knowing you all.. We are not actually enemies. It is the snakes who divide us. We actually all need the same thing.
Take care and God bless your souls. Seek for truth. Throw away the little fish and look for the big one.
I hope all of you make money but remember winning is the same as losing. If you lost money, it can sometimes lead you to something greater.
I'm going to go on my scooter again tonight. Now I don't even listen to music. I want to hear the sounds of nature.

I'm guessing a huge number of people are buying options for Tellurian and not buying the stock. Whenever the marketwatch page ranks higher than this Yahoo page in Google you kinda know it. It happened before when Tellurian went under 0.7 last year. This is what I perceive. As you might well know, we are just cattle in this world being manipulated by bankers on Wall Street but it kinda tells you that these stocks and other O&G stocks are being manipulated by a select few at this moment. My hunch is to keep holding all my O&G stocks. Thats just me for what it is worth.
Being a shareholder here has taught me a lot. A lot about lies .. complete lies. The whole world and it's media is a lie. Ask yourself why there as so many obelisks in every country? Our world is not being run by the people who we think it is run by. Neither have we been taught correct history, geography, geology, medicine, science and all religious leaders are part of those groups too and have been corrupted. All of them are corrupt and compromised. There is not even one who does good - yeh not even ONE. They are just playing games and making a show. All of them with the same purse and what they do harms the common man and the poor.
This is a strange time for sure. I can't help feeling they are scared to death of something .. probably fearing their destruction. Something like a meltdown coming like it probably did in the 1800's .. events which their historians have hidden from us.
What I'm thinking now is - "Do for others what you want them to do for you" This is the meaning of the law and prophets. These wicked men who have penetrated and who lead every walk of life to lead us will surely meet their destruction. That is a guaranteed!
If we fear God and do good to others (especially those not in our camp) we have nothing to fear.
Take care everyone.

Has anyone read the prospectus about the offering of stock on the resale market? When reading this does not look to good in the short term. Here is just a piece of what is stated on the website. You can find this on the company website. Any thoughts

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, which is incorporated in this prospectus by reference, as well as the risk factors set forth in any applicable prospectus supplement and the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in this prospectus. If any of the events described in such "Risk Factors" disclosures occurs or such risks otherwise materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects could be materially adversely affected.

Resales of our common stock in the public market following an offering may cause the trading price to fall.

Resales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could depress the trading price of our common stock. An offering of new shares of our common stock could result in resales of our common stock by our current stockholders concerned about the potential dilution of their holdings. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market following an offering, the trading price of our common stock could fall.

If you purchase our common stock in an offering, you may experience immediate dilution.

Because the price per share of our common stock being offered may be higher than the book value per share of our common stock, you may suffer immediate and substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of the common stock you purchase in an offering. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock in future offerings could be dilutive to stockholders if they do not invest in future offerings. Moreover, to the extent that we issue options or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of our common stock in the future and those options, warrants or other securities are exercised, converted or exchanged, stockholders may experience further dilution.

Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, may adversely affect our efforts to reach a final investment decision with respect to the Driftwood Project.

Pandemics or disease outbreaks such as the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak may have a variety of adverse effects on our business, including by depressing commodity prices and the market value of our securities and limiting the ability of our management to travel to meet with partners and potential partners. Prospects for the development and financing of the Driftwood Project are based in part on factors including global economic conditions that have been, and are likely to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional effects of the pandemic on our business may include limits on the ability of our employees, or those of partners or vendors, to provide necessary services due to illness or quarantines and governmental restrictions on travel, imports or exports or financial transactions.

Rystad Energy: with the likelihood for significant Mozambique LNG project delays, global LNG market balances could face annual deficits sooner this decade Rystad estimates nearly 9 mtpa of would-be supply has been removed between 2026 and 2030, flipping expectations from that of a loose market to one of tightness

2) Dry weather (lack of hydro) and new LNG-to-power projects are driving a record year for Brazilian LNG imports with YTD volumes up ~135% YoY

3) As OPEC+ eases supply cuts this month, Saudi Arabia is planning to turn towards more natural gas-for-power as associated supplies become available in 2020, crude burned for power in the Kingdom peaked at 720,000 bpd, while that volume had dropped to 335,000 bpd as of Feb-2021, per JODI

Seems Wall Street Bets draws attention to Tell ... I like it! Moreover if this movement is put in place via WSB I do not see it as a pumping of stock, but rather a return to its intrinsic value before Covid which was between $8.00 and $10.00 with in addition one without debt !! !!! Wow I hope this movement will take place ... I'm more than tired of short selling which only drives stocks down for no valid fundamental reasonsüí™üèª
And all this without even mentioning the future Driftwood contract;) which could propel the title towards $20-25 or more in a few months / years !!

Always remember that Total has sold 26 MILLION of its 46 million shares (> 50%) that it acquired for $4.50 each.

Engie has also pulled out of $NEXT ... that should give everyone a pause.

Regardless of whether someone believes that Tellurian will be a worthwhile invest in the long run (I'm undecided), there are three indisputable facts that seem to be misunderstood by some on this forum.

1) Tellurian is not currently profitable.
2) Dilution has been ongoing and has not been insignificant.
3) Tell paid off it's loans (at least partially) through equity issuances rather than through earnings.

Don't jump me. It isn't inherently a bad thing to be unprofitable in a company's early days (Amazon wasn't for years). Dilution is not uncommon and doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem. It's a management decision to decide how to address cash flow concerns.

There's much talk on this board about "shorts" and "market manipulation." I think this is a misplaced sentiment and I'm of the opinion that the price is reflective of the company's current standing and is appropriate based on their publicly available filings. It just appears that many aren't actually reading them.

Last year, state-run PetroNet LNG Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Houston-based LNG developer Tellurian Inc. for $2.5 billion for rights of up to 5 million tonnes per year of LNG over the lifespan of the project marking the largest investment by an Indian company in U.S. LNG.

The money will go to the Driftwood LNG project for natural gas production, gathering, processing, and transportation facilities, as well as a proposed 27.6 mtpa liquefaction export facility that will be built near Lake Charles, Louisiana, on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

This brings India's total LNG investments in the U.S. to $4 billion to date, with the Asian nation having contracted a total of 9 million metric tonnes per annum of LNG from U.S. shale producers, making it the 6th largest buyer of U.S. LNG.

The fact that it hit $3 today is a signal to buy on a dip.
##############################
##############################
Has anyone seen (heard from) Whoopsie? Is he okay?
##############################
##############################
@WoospB, do you think Total pulls out of $TELL completely before end June? They have other headaches to take care of like activist pressure at home, Mozambique force majeure, and general over exposure to LNG. I doubt they remain vested after 3-4 years of waiting. COVID derailed everyone's plans but even so it was bad execution on the part of Meg to not have plan B in place for Petronet. Neither did $NEXT who were left for dead by the roadside when Engie pulled out in Nov. last year. Best case scenario is that if FID comes by mid 2022, they may have first gas by 2026 (4 years for construction including delays). Still doubtful if Bechtel gets the go-ahead next year (they said 1Q 2022) for FEED work, and there's no mention of any pre-FEED or other contract awards for Driftwood. Just some nonsense about site prep, gas gathering from sellers, more acreage needed, etc. They still playing hookie.
##############################
##############################
TELL is conducting business responsibly.
*clean balance sheet
*producing gas and acquiring additional
*announcing no commercial deals until all are finalized and ready to go. (not jerking us around with tentative news like mou with Petronet.
I believe announcement of deals will come all at once...package deal (purpose for all of Total's moves)...after everything is in place ...FID. It will be one big party and shorts will be left paying the bill.
##############################
##############################
I said that TELL is a no lose investment from this point. Price will always come back to here and can only go forward and to buy all the dips. I think my point is becoming clear. You will not see a return to $1.00; that is completely out of the realm of reality now. Even $2.00 will be difficult to get, but if you get it, buy it. It's really all onward and upward from here. $10,000 invested today will get you an easy 4x in the near term. 9x midterm, and 19x or more long-term depending on how long you hold. And then there is the dividend. It's the perfect investment.

No U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are expected to be sanctioned this year, marking the second year in a row developers may postpone moving ahead with facilities, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Consultants during a webcast last week said domestic final investment decisions (FID) were unlikely as sponsors struggle to secure long-term contracts
‚ÄúGenerally, we‚Äôve seen a slowdown in the pace of sales contract activity,‚Äù said Wood Mackenzie‚Äôs Alex Munton, principal analyst for North American LNG. ‚ÄúPre-FID projects will continue to struggle to secure buyers, given the huge wave of LNG currently under construction globally. For that reason, we see a limited window to project FIDs in the U.S. for the next couple of years.‚Äù
Some projects may not survive, he said, noting Annova LNG‚Äôs decision to shelve its South Texas development.
Sanctioning LNG projects ground to a halt last year as the Covid-19 pandemic caused already sluggish gas demand to weaken further. U.S. sponsors, including Tellurian Inc., NextDecade Corp. and Sempra Energy, pushed project sanctions originally scheduled for 2020 into 2021.

ENBL is currently trading at $7 +. May 7th is the date ladies and gentlemen. Happy Friday.

##############################
Long or short we have to be aware going into May you are making a bet on a binary outcome. If we get a FID before June the stock will skyrocket and make longs alot of money in the short term and continue to grow massively over the following years. Alternatively if we don't get a FID the stock price will plumit over fears that Total could exit their agreement to invest in Driftwood. I believe over the long-term Tellurian will be successful but in the short term getting a FID will be pivotal in the performance of the stock price and anyone investing or shorting should understand that risk.

ROTH Capital, on the other hand, stated in their research note that they expect to see TELL reach a price target of $5.25. The rating they have provided for TELL stocks is ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù according to the report published on June 10th, 2020.

Been a reader here for a while, Long TELL investor and finally writing a post. Stay focused on the fundamentals, leadership and vision. Everyone should take on big risk in their lifetime that could garner 10-15x gains. This is it for me. After tons of DD, there‚Äôs no other in this industry that comes close to the reward here. You are buying into a transformational vision like Tesla, Amazon, etc. and have a chance to get in early while there‚Äôs trepidation. Name another vision in this industry that even comes close to TELL? So many shorters here taking advantage of fear mongering to get people to lose their long-term potential. Why settle for a loss in the short-term? Everyone needs to stay confident and wait this out.

With XOP trading at a recent price near $84.22 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.08% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of XOP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Alto Ingredients Inc (ALTO), Tellurian Inc (TELL), and Par Pacific Holdings Inc (PARR). Although ALTO has traded at a recent price of $5.33/share, the average analyst target is 153.28% higher at $13.50/share. Similarly, TELL has 103.72% upside from the recent share price of $2.18 if the average analyst target price of $4.44/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PARR to reach a target price of $18.00/share, which is 32.45% above the recent price of $13.59.

Hi everyone, this is an email that I sent to Tellurian Investors Relations 3 weeks ago. They just got back to me. What are your thoughts?

We are considering either Tellurian Inc. or NextDecade Corp. Before we make our final decision could you please answer the following questions?
 
i. What is your consensus on Tellurian repaying its 2019 term loan in full after making a voluntary prepayment of approximately $38 million? Is this a ploy to gain potential investors?

Deleveraging was a major focus for us once the equity markets reopened and commercial LNG discussions resumed. It allows us much more flexibility.
 
ii. What are your thoughts on Total selling more than half of their shares? And what does this mean concerning the Driftwood project? 

Total is still a party to the Driftwood agreement, we can‚Äôt really comment on their common share ownership but their selling has been pretty measured.
 
iii. Will Tellurian be able to start the Driftwood project before June to preserve their agreement with Total? Do Tellurian have all the relevant permits? Who are the big players supporting Tellurian and their position in the company? 

We indeed have all the relevant permits and expect to start construction this year
 
iv. With the U.S. Natural Gas export being at a record high week ending March 24, do you expect Tellurian to have a decent Q1 overall?
Why do you think Morgan Stanley has adjusted their price target on Tellurian to $2 from $6 and have maintained an underweight rating (03/26/2021)?

MS has been negative on the natural gas sector as a whole for some time
 
v. With the Driftwood project still very much in the pipeline, what are Tellurian's main income streams?

Our natural gas sales from our producing properties in the Haynesville shale
 
vi. How are negotiations going with India's Petronet?

Petronet is on pause for time being but given India‚Äôs natural gas demand growth we very much Petronet or one of their affiliates to be involved in Driftwood
 
vii. Will the results from the binding open season on April 4th be made public? If so when?

The pipeline open seasons will not be made public until after FID
##############################
##############################
I got a question. If your shorting and it doesnt trigger your OCO but the stock doesnt move one way or another do you have to pay a fee for shorting?
(Let say you short at 2.07 and it ends at 2.07 do you pay a fee for shorting?)
Also can you close out your short daily?

Sorry for all the question. Thank you

it is not so easy to arrange/build lng plants - even those with huge pockets and an import plant conversion project are quite a ways out to completion -- compare this to tiny TELL with an option to purchase a piece of property that they have been trying to achieve FID for 3yrs now. if driftwood actually happens it will likely be 2026 or later before first production/sales

Golden Pass LNG across the pass from Cheniere [LNG] this is a liquefied natural gas export project on the Texas coast sponsored by ExxonMobil Corp. and state-owned Qatar Petroleum (QP), is asking FERC for more time to place its facilities into service, citing permitting delays. Golden Pass told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that it expects to place its three trains in service on a staggered schedule, with Train 1 slated to come online ‚Äúno later than September 30, 2025‚Äù; Train 2 by March 31, 2026; and Train 3 by Nov. 30, 2026.
and btw - I hope TELL does pull it off some day as I will jump on when they actually have something more than a dream.

They said they aren't going to sanction the first phase of 16 MTPA until they have sufficient gas production to supply it. 16 MTPA would require about 2.5 BCF/day of gas production. Their current gas production is about 0.033 BCF/day. The largest gas producer in the US, EQT, produces about 4 BCF/day, the second largest, Exxon, produces about 2.8 BCF/day. BP, no. 4, produces 2.4 BCF/day.

In other words, they are saying they plan to grow their upstream gas production business to a size equal to the 3rd largest gas producer in the US before they sanction the first phase of LNG project.

Do any of you people actually read and understand this or realize just how preposterous that is?
##############################
##############################
Total has sold an additional 4 Mil shares of $TELL and now owns just 4.95% of the company per the latest 8-K filed today. This is really ominous coming as it is before the start of summer. No Petronet or other deal , CEO quit, major partner reduced stake by more than half, share dilution and guess what --cheerleaders are still pumping this. Doubt if their project ever takes off. No one needs that much LNG not in the US and not in the world certainly. Plus 10-20 year contracts are so ancient history. $NEXT is already a goner, fyi.

I believe that they are expanding ther wells. with debt paid setting in for the long term. unless they have an ace in there pocket and wild card, they are extending time until a large investor will emerge. they won't fold ,just a smaller company. worth only 4 to six dollars. being sold short to drive price down but won't close them...

@f, You think it‚Äôs funny making threats? You‚Äôre part of the problem, not the solution. I very much agree with woospy‚Äôs comments. Like others hear with open minds, I listen and he/she been dead on accurate with most of his post. I‚Äôve personally made good money listening to woospy.

I don‚Äôt normally post but do give thumbs. From my viewpoint, I‚Äôve seen longs constantly attacking anyone that says anything negative referencing TELL. When a person (like woospy says) gets it back, you longs try to accuses this person of attacking you. You guys play the victim card. Man up! Or even better, be polite to each other. I‚Äôve seen woospy be very nice to posters that don‚Äôt agree with him/her at all.

It‚Äôs easier to catch flys with honey not vinegar.

To me, you‚Äôre just another another angry long hiding behind a new fake account. I would put money on it that you are one of the man people fighting with him/her everyday. Now that you‚Äôve created another account, you think your a big man.

Hello, could someone provide me the source for being dept free? And if I also may ask, how did they finance the dept payment? I mean their finances are still in the red (at the moment not profitable) and if they are paying dept, they have financed it somehow. I am interested what did they give away to pay the dept and what are the possible outcomes of such a deal.

I am bullish for the company in long term, but short term I am neutral. But if they truly are now dept free, I am interested how they managed to do so and did they take new loans to cover the old ones or not or did they OTC some shares/gave away options to cover the dept.

##############################
People stop trying to annoy others around. For example people calling WoospB all kind of things but yet he/she in my opinion has been quite rational - and actually quite clever and he brings up quite important points that one can easily miss by accident. If you have a differing opinion just say in what you disagree and why versus try to bully someone for having a different opinion and making this forum a toxic place. That's how we can all benefit from differing opinions and learn new point of views.

Personally:
I am bullish for the stock long term but neutral/bearish for the short term. I will retain my position and I will not touch it until 2025 unless something really big happens. Could my money be invested in better investments/bets? Of course, but one needs to find them first.

$TELL is a hype stock since 2017. Market cap too high for $30 M in rev. How long can it go on like this with funny videos to keep longs entrapped? Downtrend won't end until they actually do something about their project, which they can't because no investors, no buyers (customers) and certainly no partners. Total will exit this by June just like Engie exited $NEXT last Nov. All these me-2 LNG plays are doomed for failure. $NGL is a perfect example. Sell and move on, nothing to see here.

It's a good company. Biggest issue that's keeping the stock price down is the threat of share issuance/dilution. I'd rather take on more debt than issue more shares if I were Charif Souki, but that's just me. I remember watching this one when it was trading in the $0.70-0.80 range. Thought of going in but did not like the amount of shares outstanding. But I really do like the company. Natural gas and, by extension, LNG is my favorite type of fossil fuel. We'll need it as a transitionary energy source for a while until we fully transition over to renewables.

I suspect that when TELL starts drilling and announces their forward relationships, it will catch many off guard. The move will be sharply higher as investors scramble to get in. You will then have a debt-free international energy company. This one will catch many off guard, including institutions that are not already on board. There are several major institutions currently long on TELL so not everyone will miss out on the first super move.

WINTA, What is the deal with your weird statements that have no meaning?
##############################
##############################
TELL is not the only stock recovering to much higher levels as the economy reopens worldwide. Reopening economy means AHT is recovering. Probably going back to $30 with restored dividend. Their structure requires a dividend. Could go much higher longer term, but 6 months to 2 years (maybe sooner) easily back to $30 minimum.
##############################
##############################
Market is getting knocked down due to triggered margin calls. Has nothing to do with the quality of TELL. Dips, buy the dips if you need more.
##############################
##############################
The two best trades for the next two years will be TELL and HYSR. Combine both into your portfolio. The move against global warming and into green tech is increasing and will become a serious force. HYSR is going to be on the leading edge. Definitely take advantage of the current prices. Natural Gas is the bridge to green tech and therefore, natural gas will be the go to for a long time because it will support green tech. Additionally, TELL is looking into carbon capture pertaining to natural gas and therefore, TELL will be supported by governments and corporations needing a smaller carbon footprint. This is your time to go where success will arrive to get TELL and HYSR now. Sorry to sound like a commercial, but I am totally correct on all these points. Cast away your doubt and fear and get your seat locked in for this energy ride. HYSR for hydrogen and TELL for a two decade supporting role toward green tech. Things will begin to happen very quickly soon and you do not want to have to scramble in fear of missing out when it starts. Just quietly get your seat and don't fear red because red becomes green. Ups and downs and all par for the course; get used to it and let the future carry high into green territory where you will then have a champagne problem. I will be there also so come ride with me to success. Ride with me for two years then we will discuss how to manage our winnings. Now is the time! Patience is the key.

Quatar is expanding by 30 MTPA, slightly more capacity than Driftwood or Rio Grande LNG.

I bring you @WoospB.

1 year data collected only from Yahoo Tellurian Conversation, offending people every single day.

He produced here:

7824 - posts/replies in 365 days, that's 21 posts per day.

323 times - he called someone moron, that's almost 1 per day for a whole year.

276 times - he called someone dumb

177 times - he said it was easy money/profit to him.

173 times - he said he always win.

144 times - he called someone a loser.

149 times - he said someone is idiot.

31 times - he said someone was being ridiculous.

I stopped here as I could keep extracting data but I guess my point is already made.

He also used to other Stocks conversations for instance an Airline company where he first tried to make friends, but later he started offending and became bitter with everyone there until he left.

I could track this person more and more as it's something pretty easy to me, he thinks he knows me but he really doesnt.

As you all can see he's a sick person and should go after some help, my experience says that we should just treat him as a "special friend", and wish someone close to him offer some help at some point.

The proof of all I wrote above is in this plain text public bin:

I will leave now as I'm a busy person and will not engage with him, I wish all you the best.

I own shares of TELL and am admittedly underwater on my position. I continue to think TELL is worthwhile speculative play long term. With that said, many of the people telling you to buy today were the ones telling you to buy 3 months ago when this was trading around $4 per share as well. If they were wrong then, there's no reason they can't be wrong again now. This incessant urge to average down at all cost makes little sense either. It could work or it could be a wealth destroyer.

Magellan Petroleum Corporation (TELL) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.09. This compares to loss of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11.11%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced break-even earnings, delivering a surprise of 100%.
Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

Magellan Petroleum Corporation, which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, posted revenues of $8.71 million for the quarter ended March 2021, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 50.58%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $8.22 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.

For what it's worth, I would like nothing more than for Tellurian to succeed. Because of Tellurian and buying at the low, then selling when the indicators confirmed decline, I'm up over half a million dollars. I would like to buy back, but not until a trend reversal is confirmed. I've made the mistake in the past getting emotionally vested in companies only to get financially wrecked. There are millions of companies and not all are going to be winners. Stocks do not care that you own them. Learn some technical analysis and merge what you've learned with fundamentals and macro. Don't be blinded by emotion. The entire Market is a house of cards right now. Going long on ANYTHING is a bad idea. Something to consider. Best of luck.

TELLLLLLLLL SHORTS, you am lost
##############################

It should be easy to see that TELL will return to $10 as it heads higher over time. So from here, you are getting an easy 5X return at a minimum. Consider they have paid much of their debt with their own production and will be debt free very soon. Now, imagine their revenue now combined with international sales from the new pipes soon to be installed. Get the picture?
##############################
##############################
Very disappointing to see insiders and Total selling in the low 2s. Obviously they are not pleased to see Soukii drilling holes in the ground gambling shareholder money.
Cheniere is making more profits in a month then TELL's entire market cap. Wish they could find a way to break through but with China not buying any US LNG, this biotch is dead money.
Sorry to say that but I'm sick of Souki's distractions.
##############################
##############################
At best this is a pump and dump based on Souki's periodic pep talk videos. Nothing substantial by way of a commercial agreement, let alone FID for the Driftwood project. $TELL like $NEXT and $NGL is hanging by a thread. Its inability to close above $2 signals that it will retest $1.50 support sometime soon, maybe before or just after ER next week. They do not have the revenues to support this valuation and stock should slowly drift to below a buck before EOY 2021. Good luck, you're gonna need it.

What is Total's current ownership in $TELL? They sold about 15 million shares in March, bringing their total to about 30-31 Million. What is the latest? In any event, Tellurian is toast. Simply no appetite for more LNG projects with too much US capacity already and no demand rise. The 3rd world dumps India and Brazil will suppress any chances of global oil gas demand recovery for another year at least. Annova, $NEXT, $TELL all these will soon bite the dust. Longs simply too slow on the uptake to realize whats going on. But of course you can still smoke the Souki peace pipe while watching the Leave Meg Gently movie.

This is interesting! Notice they don‚Äôt mention the $27 0.3 million in liabilities. This is equal to total assets. That cracks me up. No wonder you guys think they are debt free. Hahahahahaha! It‚Äôs easy to see who reads SEC filing vs who only reads articles.

Tellurian ended its first quarter of 2021 with approximately $58.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately $17.0 million in short-term borrowings (which was repaid in April 2021), and generated approximately $8.7 million in revenues from natural gas sales. Tellurian has a strong balance sheet consisting of approximately $270.3 million in total assets. Tellurian reported a net loss of approximately $27 million, or $0.08 per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

There seems to be quite a lot of negativity on here dismissing the potential of this stock. Sure this is a gamble, just like any other stock. I have ridden this to highs of $4 and lows under 80 cents. My average is 1.3 so my returns stand around 90%. Am I prepared to lose my investment... yes because I understand the risk. Everyone has the right to voice their opinions but why do certain members continuously beat this stock down. I am interested in both the positive and negative posts as it gives me a better insight on what maybe happening. I am only a small investor with no experience in dealing etc, but I do see the huge potential if driftwood and new partnerships are made. We can all agree to disagree but keep the insults to yourselves. We all want to make money and I could have made more by shorting if I had a better risk appetite. Good luck to EVERYONE long or short. üëç

TELL is becoming srping loaded to the upside. Today was an easy decision; added 10,000 shares are $1.62. If we are fortunate enough to get back to $1.00, I have $20K ready to deploy. I know Souki will not like it if it does that, and I am not saying it will, but if it does . . .

There is $100 million short right now on the basis of false and erroneous notions. This means the short squeeze can be one of those rockets too fast to catch, so you should catch it in these lows.

There are professional trash talk companies that send in their employee troops to talk sheet about upstart companies, so they can go short. They usually show up after the stock has risen some. Sometimes they start early without shorting simply to acquire a long position lower. These trash talk parasites sometime show up in two and three to act as a team. Ultimately, they will go long when the success is undeniable and their tactics can no longer be convincing. I am sorry for some of you sincere investors that are caught in this process, but mark this day and learn from watching it.

Don, I agree with you that TELL will return to around $10/shares. At some point, the price will stay so low they'll have to do a reverse split to stay listed. Good call!! I'm willing to bet before that happens we will see dilution as they near running out of cash later in the year. If they don't find a partner or financing in the next 24 months, its over! And this is what the financials will tell you. Maybe take a peak instead of trusting a salesman.

Hey guys - I am not attached to most of my stocks but I admit I am attached to Tellurian and I like Souki from what I know of him. I'm certainly not gay but I admire men who don't give up through tough times and maintain their integrity. A lot of people like him are struggling now in some way and not giving up on their dreams. The fight is what keeps us alive, not the money.

Of course people need money so go ahead if you want to buy/sell, short or day trade this stock right now but I'm locked into this company. I don't need the extra money from Tellurian right now. It is my favourite stock and best leader/personality. I hope to meet Souki one day and shake his hand. I hope he will have time for me. I also dream to meet some of you in a meeting in the future when things are better. It should be fun!

Fellow longs.. I think a lot of you want to make this board useful. I'm curious to know what other things some of you guys are investing in right now? My portfolio has a lot of oil & gas stocks, drillers, some gold mines, special metals, rare earths, lithium, EV's, UK construction companies and some airplane manufacturers as well as crypto mining related stocks. Don has mentioned a few stocks, so has Grey . Anyone else have anything they think might be of interest to some of us and why? I like to catch things early, I don't normally buy into strength.. I buy into depression. I'm accumulating for example on a very depressed phosphate stock that never moves (the banker warns me about it saying it is very "liquid" ) .. but I'm accumulating for 2024. Yes.. I'm willing to wait that long. Please feel free to say anything you want. I'm happy to see we discussed H2 and EV's just now and I learned something so thanks!

According to Zachs Investors in Tellurian need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 21, 2022 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.
So this can go big, up or down. Time will tell but hopefully it will go up.

‚ÄúWe can issue the notice to proceed when the timing is right,‚Äù Sim√µes said, when asked about timing for a final investment decision (FID). The company had previously targeted a 2021 FID for the Driftwood LNG project.

‚ÄúThere are some scenarios where we think we could do it before the end of the year, and there are some scenarios where it would be early next year,‚Äù he said. Tellurian had not ‚Äúcommitted to anything at this point.‚Äù

‚ÄúSignificantly short for a long period of time‚Äù is what he said. That means the price ain‚Äôt coming back this year IMO.
##############################
##############################
Those of you STILL yammering on about Driftwood. Understand the first phase of the project is about securing upstream reserves. "Upstream" are points in production that originate early on in the process. Progress there will be the "canary in the coal mine". Five years and no significant progress. Yet.

"Tellurian Inc. President and CEO Oct√°vio Sim√µes told S&P Global Platts on March 25 that the company will not sanction its proposed Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana until it has secured sufficient upstream reserves for the 16-Mt/y first phase of the project. Since Tellurian has only a small acreage position in Louisiana‚Äôs Haynesville Shale, the developer would need to acquire a significant amount of drilling rights to meet its goal."

I'm curious. Why is t e l l holding financing commitments so close to its chest? We can all agree I think that it's going to take more than one financial commitment to bridge the gap of needed funds to go ahead with the FID. If that's so, why not make an announcement about any commitments made to date? It seems like it would support the stock price, and possibly encourage others to make commitments also. Can anyone explain to me why it would be a smart strategy to hold any existing commitments from the public eye at this time?

5. World population grow even with covid and need energy
6. Everything go back to normal
7. During texas cold is not new energy that has warm up your house is gas because solar panel was cover buy snow and wing by ice
8. Prize of gas still very high in lng market: japon korea and also in dutch TTP

##############################
In is possible that TELL was being bid down by the professionals, so they could get more shares. This happens because they also see the obvious coming success. I noticed the usual negative articles awhile back. They were designed to talk the price down, but I also noticed they couldn't really state any facts; it was just doubt casting. The only specific was "debt" which is always the "go to" rant in articles with a slant to the negative. The fact is, in business, debt is a tool. And now that TELL has paid off one loan and will soon pay off all to become debt free, there really isn't any negative left. The odds here are definitely in your favor and strongly so. In my view, on the basis of knowledge, information, and belief, TELL is a sure thing.

It never fails to amaze me how many times I see rising companies with CEO telling everyone exactly what is going to happen forward and the stock lingers for a period long enough to acquire shares and then one day, it rises like the Phoenix, heads toward the moon, and the rest is history.

Given the fact that TELL is able to pay off all debt, and considering they are about to open new pipes for internation distribution, I really think there will be a dividend in the future. I also think TELL is a $40 stock in the future and possibly much higher. Some have suggested as high as $80. Everyone speculates so allow me to speculate also. I will speculate on a 3% yield even though many energy companies pay double and triple that amount. So I have 30,000 shares and at $40 that would be $1,200,000 and at 3% my annual yield would be $36,000. Even if I only received half that amount, it is nevertheless a great situation because the yield could seed many other investments. I am sure most of you could suggest improved scenarios for that amount of money as can I, but I am simply keeping the calculations simple.

I am sure most of us would agree that TELL will easily go to $20, and I am suggesting that $20 would be a serious support base. $40, $50, and $60 are certainly in the cards for an internation energy distributor with no debt. Those who suggested TELL could reach $80 are not being unreasonable.

Trolls and trash talkers may now commence firing.

Hey Grey If you remember I mentioned loading up on UKOG and went long. It is going nuts today because the Turkish ministry approved their license. You previously recommended us all to 88 Energy and thanks for recommending it but I still can't get those shares without going through my banker. I'm seeing a new broker on Monday who will find me a way to get those difficult to get shares in larger amounts. I think you have found out when you use certain apps, they limit the amount you can buy at anyone one time. That is why I used a broker in the past, even if they charge a lot -at least you can get as many shares as you want. I think people in the USA don't have this issue.
But I also think a lot of Americans can't even get a hold of many of the shares we purchase because the popular apps don't even support it.

##############################
Shovel Ready Infrastructure
Gee, what we need is more shovel ready projects that will bring about a cleaner, greener economy‚Ä¶
Shovel Ready #1- TELL has already acquired or has secured rights to suitable land in Louisiana for the site of Driftwood
Shovel Ready #2- TELL has already secured large tax abatements from local entities as an inducement to build and locate the facility in Louisiana.
Shovel Ready #3- TELL has applied for and received all required environmental approvals, both state and National.
Shovel Ready #4- TELL has already negotiated with the Prime Contractor on the job (Bechtel) and signed an agreement including costs.
Shovel Ready #5- TELL has already made contact with GE regarding design and purchase of new age compressors needed for this project.
Shovel Ready #5- TELL has already, in conjunction with Bechtel, completed engineering documents and design.
Shovel Ready #6- TELL already has the sourcing for gas for the first phase of the project in proved reserves in the Haynesville field. No need to go searching, its already proven. More supply is available as needed as more phases come on line.
This project fits the theme of green energy more than almost any type of investment. The Natural gas supplied to the World as a result of this project will go to replace dirty fuels like wood, and coal in developing areas of the globe such as India, and the Far East. It also would reduce ‚Äúflaring‚Äù in the US as surplus gas would be absorbed into the market due to supply demands. The US wants to be aligned with US Paris accords. So prove it, by reducing pollution globally by having other countries burn cleaner Natural gas. There is no real alternative that would be considered green to power the emerging countries in the world other than Natural Gas.
Can you ‚ÄúDig‚Äù it?

Looks like the next 4-5 months are going to prove either Phil or Tom to be correct. If no construction begins as promised, Tom will be proven correct. If FID is in fact reached and some level of construction begins, Phil will be rewarded for his unending devotion to TELL.

If you‚Äôre shorting this stock, why not go to a different forum?

There is nothing wrong with TELL. All is good. Don't listen to these jokers who know about the heavy shorting. It is not reflective of reality and quoting some published short percent does not tell the actual story - which Souki kindly explained to us in the past (if people listened carefully) which means Souki has been invaluable to me , helping me personally understand other stocks.
These dudes are simply shorting and trying to make a self fulfilling prophecy come true. People can react in any way they want but I am going to do my part and not join them.

Souki has already won over ICahn in my books. I would not be surprised if ICahn is not around for much longer. Its says he is 85 years old. What a waste of a life. Reasonable businessmen do not take revenge, they move on to greater things. What greater things is ICahn doing? Honestly, I can't see anything good about him.
Someone like Souki is brave and fearless, not needing to hide/use all that money to get shills to do your bidding. He comes out unashamed and updates us with the videos. I also learn so much from him.
I'm proud to be a shareholder here . Let ICahn can go bury himself and those around him. I can wait!

Serious question and please serious answers only.
If FID doesn't happen ever, what is TELL worth? i.e. what are its assets worth?
I hope it is worth more than today's price.
##############################
##############################
Strong TELL to $2.77 sooner than you think .
##############################
##############################
@Woodspb ancestors are the woolly mammoth. Look it up.
##############################
##############################
Although the stock has pulled back from higher prices, TELL remains susceptible to further declines. A reversal of the existing trend looks unlikely at this time. The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. TELL's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI, is negative. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days, indicating that TELL is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of TELL. TELL could find secondary support at its rising 200-day moving average.-MarketEdge

##############################
##############################
I'll say this once, then wish you all; "best of luck". Tellurian fell this morning under the 200 day exponential moving average. It needs to close today above $2.25 to remain hopeful. Don't shoot the messenger.

##############################
##############################
The current price is not a "downturn". It's an opportunity to accumulate. We've been much lower even of recent. I suspect professionals are bidding it lower to quietly accumulate shares. More traders are seeing that TELL is underway to outperform. The only thing they have to go on is the charts which doesn't tell the true story. The CEO is telling the true story. Only technical "analcists" would use charts to trade TELL. When the digging starts, the charts will be closed and only the scramble to get in will exist. This happens so many times. All you need is as much TELL as you can hold and 3 to 5 years. Prepare to retire or at least live debt free.

Imagine that TELL will return to $1.00. OMG if only that could happen. I would buy an additional 50,000 shares at $1.00. The thing is, my biggest gains have been with stocks that were obviously awesome and yet, they lingered for long periods (months and years) before rocketing. TELL is expected to begin growing soon and continue upward for a long time. It's OK to hold TELL 10 years; even longer if a dividend arrives.

I've been accumulating here for over one year. Quite frankly, nothing moves me anymore. If I regret anything, it is only that I did not buy more of this stock when it was much cheaper but that is how it goes. I have always been bullish since day 1 when I saw Souki on Youtube speak about his business model and future supply/demand. That was enough for me! I was impressed by a revolutionary businessman!
As time has gone by and I find out about Icahn's insecurity and ambitions to crush Souki by all means possible, my respect for Souki has increased tenfold. I've watched ICahn too and he seems like one of the most boring people on the planet. There is no way I'd pay to go and listen to him. Not someone you could look up to and be inspired by.

Hmm Surprisingly, I was hoping to read what @mariana thoughts this morning. There are three distinct patterrns on this board. (1)@mariana pump it and dump it, so @marianna probably will get out at $3 and then bash the stock to buy on the dip. @Woodspb short and bash the #$%$ out of the stock to collect his pennies and then there are the rest of the hopeful longs. In either cases, the longs are in for a money ride to the top. The questions i am beginning to think is when should I get out? Where is the right top to get out?

This applies to crypto mining but it also applies to data centers and in fact, to anything "green" .. Yeh, people can put a green energy project in the forefront but actually the real power is always supplied when the load cannot be met and that is by fossil fuels. More and more hiding of fossil fuel plants and in our case "gas fired" plants. Take a look at Germany who is depending on Nordstream II for a temporary fix to it's upcoming energy shortage. The energy consumption is only going to increase and we have only JUST begun.

Look at the quote below from a trusted crypto mining source...... See how they cannot survive on renewable energy.. Hey guys -- what on earth is going to happen when all the countries have their own digital currencies.. Woah! .. You are probably talking thousands more of terawatt hours. Even with ALL the current projects and proposed new projects will it be enough? Think about it!!..

"Reprogramming of the current mining chips. Against common belief, the crypto mining industry is a relatively green one. As of December 2019, Bitcoin was powered by over 70% of renewable electricity. While the benefits of using renewables are undisputed, the truth is that renewables are an intermittent source of energy and are not always reliable for Bitcoin miners, who have a constant energy requirement. Fossil fuel-based power, on the contrary, serves generally as a more steady source of energy. To strike a balance between the sustainability of the industry and sustainability more broadly, a hybrid model can be adopted, whereby renewables are used predominantly as an energy source, with fossil fuel-based power setting in during production shortages. This entails redesigning and reprogramming current mining chips to enable greater ease of toggling between the two variants of energy sources, with no disruption to the mining processes."

OK so I am prevented from buying Tellurian the whole of today. Amazing! Hey Grey... This same nonsense is happening on the London Exchange too. The only way to beat it is to buy much much larger amounts of a stock when it is depressed, then you are locked and loaded and they can't prevent you from buying. As you know, some apps let you buy but they limit the amount you can buy at any one time. For people overseas (outside USA) there are all sorts of charges involved in buying a stock, so it is not even worth to buy the small amounts they allow you to buy. This is why traders are useful. They charge a lot but at least you can get the stocks. This info might be useful to people inside the USA who don't know what is going on outside.

If you really think this is going to continue up all week you've lost your minds. Get away from emotions. It's blocking good judgment.

If today goes well, I'll be over $2 of profit per share. Looking forward to that!! Not bad after 6 weeks of trading TELL again.

Tell is dead meat.. Total the French company has pullout of the Corpus Christi project stock symbol next , Next was in the same boat as Tell trying to get the LNG export plant built. LNG demand will continue to surge in Asia, but Qatar is making its move to expand its global market share with low-cost gas and a huge expansion in capacity, which will be difficult to beat in terms of costs for new projects, including those planned in the United States.

‚ÄúI think American projects are now going to have to review their costs. The new projects will not be able to compete with the Qataris,‚Äù a gas industry participant told Reuters. Invest your money somewhere else other than Tell, and quit dreaming..

More insider selling going on. Check TELL's SEC filings. Not a good sign when they are selling and then reissuing shares to executives and board members.
##############################
##############################
If you are new to the board go to YouTube and watch Souki‚Äôs most recent Tellurian YouTube vids.
##############################
##############################
‚ÄúTellurian only has enough cash to fund another 4-6 months of expenses before the company needs to raise more capital,‚Äù and that‚Äôs a fact.
##############################
##############################
Hard to know exactly, but ‚Äúany day‚Äù is not an exaggeration regarding stock offering because they cannot just pay down debt without raising funds. They need a partner, but do not expect to know before June-July. Therefore, expect TELL shares to trade under pressure, esp. given the current market conditions.

Alright, who else thinks this will go bankrupt within the year? Souki's just so full of hot air. Promised the moon and delivered coal instead. They haven't accomplished one single milestone since they did that reverse merge with Magellan 5 years ago. Then Petronet bailed on them. Then Meg left. Then Souki woke up from his deep slumber and waddled along to push youtube videos. But ain't no one buyin that goofy nonsense no more. Its obvious where $TELL, $NEXT, $NGL all headed to .... dustbin of history. can you say giant goober

Barrons article this morning - 20 Stocks That Are More of a Gamble Than an Investment - mention Redditers etc. The 20th stock on the list is Tellurian . . . The stock was identified as a potential gamble using methodology from recently published research paper. The group proposed looking at the average volume over 30 days compared to market cap as a way of determining what they called lottery stocks. Barron's ran their own version of the fiilter and came up with 20 companies. Take this for what you will . . .

Remember these manipulators were always here using other socket accounts. I used to purchase at least once a month when this was slightly above and below $1 and clearly remember being told I was a fool by the same people using different names. Remember what Souki says. He did it before and he can do it again. My fear is not losing. My fear is missing out on a great opportunity to prosper and losing that opportunity because I listened to people who do not care about my financial welfare. They are selfish and manipulating and only care about their own short term profits, even if means that they must tell lies to others.

Regardless of your opinion if you bought at the right price point you're doing well for yourself. It's not like this company is going into bankruptcy.

Before I purchased TELL I owned a substantial amount of Hertz stock. They were in bankruptcy and I still made out like a fat cat. I can agree with Phil on a point he made. Tell is a financially stable company which makes money. They are paying off debt which will only strengthen their position in the long run. Even if TELL doesn't build a new facility their stock value will only rise. They are working a good business model. So again I will say, "if you purchased right" you have nothing to worry about.

To the TELL nay sayers, you can only tell people the sky is falling so many times before you look like a jacka$$. The proof is in the numbers and the numbers won't lie. There is money to be made here. You just have to be patient.

Always hear in well to home, LNG electricity "only" provides 30-35% less carbon than coal. What about the ash that burning coal leaves? Huge problem trying to get rid of fine ash that contains arsenic and other concentrated carcinogens.

Woospb is not a trader he is a gambler. He says he shorted at $2.20 then added multiple times to his short position "heavily" as the price continued to rise. Any decent trader has an exit plan if a trade doesn't go their way but either he was too stupid or too stubborn to let go. He is in a leveraged position with unlimited downside. He got lucky today with the market correction, but imagine if we had a positive catalyst for TELL and the stock skyrocketed. The little troll would have been margin called and forced to exit his position at a massive loss. Anyone who thinks Woospb is a skilled trader is an idiot. Be short Tellurian, that's fine, there are alot of holes you can pick in the company but to trade so recklessly is just plain... Moronic.

This looks like a pretty standard double dip crash. Will be expecting a W shaped recovery in the market in general and Tellurian should follow.

Playing with the houses money. I've been in and out of tell several times and still have a nice stake in it. Over the last few trades I've more than doubled my original investment, if it does go to 1.50 I'll buy more, then again at 1.00. No matter what though I will not lose even if it goes to 0.

Asia has no infrastructure and has no plans to make infrastructure short terms.

So many, confirmation biased diamond hand pumping clueless newb's, lying about averaging in and buying these dips. That is the WORST advise! The Market needs (and will) take a breath. Maybe a huge breath (flukin' crash). Understand? Equities will consolidate before a trend reversal can happen. Half of you have been investing for what, 12 months maybe? You think this spit is easy? "95% of retail investors will lose their money". That is statistical fact. Let that sink in and realize all your unrealistic cheer-leading and pumping doesn't mean squat. Allow this to consolidate first, then buy into strength. That is the most honest and sound advise you will hear. Take it or leave it.

Hello ladies and gentlemen.. This is a good teaching forum. It has a lot to do with understanding what someone is really saying.. Ha! Learning to read people.
What really is communication? Are you going to analyse someone and pick apart their every word and take them to court- to litigate every point because of your prejudice? Or are you going to watch what they do i.e. their positive actions to understand what and who they are and what they are "really" saying? Souki has DONE a lot of good.. even for the USA. He helped the shale boom and got that gas out to the world through Cheniere.. did he not?
Look folks.. Souki has an excellent track record. He has done great things, learned his craft through blood, sweat and tears.

In Souki's last video he kinda said that the situation regarding natural gas starvation is not going away for at least the next decade. Souki is so cool. He gives me confidence to invest in other energy stocks. BTW folks.. I have friends in the Texas /Louisiana oil patch who tell me that people are getting excited again. I guess the folks over in Pennsylvania are excited too.
I recommend (to myself too) .. to not day trade any of my Oil/Gas related stocks but to keep adding if I can.. and to wait!
We're gonna have a party in the future folks. The powers that be are messing things up for us all to become far more valuable! Korean girls will be cheering us because their K pop concerts will have plenty of power for those extra lights

I will say again guys... a dip is NORMAL! Powell is making an announcement with the treasury yield bonds today based on inflation, so many weak hands are liquidating and going cash. The fundamental have not changed here today, last week, or a month ago. Souki‚Äôs plan is in clear line of sight going forward. TA on charts will be out the door when FID is announced if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre basing your predictions on. @Everyone, I hope you don‚Äôt have to buy back in high for your sake.

I think this would be dangerous to short. I can't see Total selling shares to leave the deal.

I think a deal is coming and FID is coming soon. "on a global basis" of course.

This could easily go to $1.00. In fact, it's more probable than not. Diamond hands and HODL huh? That's not managing your investment. You're losing your money in Stock Market Vegas not knowing when to fold. Keep believing while the entire Market is crumbling and about to tumble. Remember, it's NEVER wrong to take profit. May not be the profit you wanted or the profit you once had ......... but sitting through a Market decline when every indicator is screaming Bearish? Now that's a special kind of stupid and you're the last person who should be giving advise. Smart money is either already out or pullin' out of this Market to wait the coming storm of pain. Timing couldn't be worse for poor 'ol Tellurian. Those on the World stage of Energy already know about Charif Souki's Driftwood LNG Fun Palace Adventure Wonderland. They're not comin' to the table in this economic environment. I can tell you that.

tom thinks I do not know what is going on. A lot of people like tom are probably not investors. They buy options. They do not care about the stock, Tellurian or Souki. They are here for a short while. Google can sometimes be your friend. When you want to see the popularity of investors vs options ratio , the marketwatch website will always be ranked higher and even above this board for tellurian share price information on google. The reason why people use marketwatch is because it has an easy layout.
If people want to buy options it is fine.. but to come here and tell lies so that you stand a better chance of winning in your puts or calls and making Souki look bad is kinda low if you ask me. Do it if you want but I prefer to have a clear conscience.
As for people who say " buy and forget and don't watch the stock" if you are a long term investor - NO! They are dead wrong. A long term investor should watch the stocks they hold regularly and form a sense of pattern recognition from whatever tools are available. Watch and learn, read all the news - even the lies. This will help you to know what else to invest in.
I am not in a boiler room. I am a retail investor and I am active. Knowing about Tellurian and excess natural gas has enabled me to see what a great future a stock like DMG blockchain has and others too. We can all learn on this board. Everything is connected. Some people here are long term investors. You have posted helpful things for me and others. Liars are also helpful.. you get to know what objections they bring up, what techniques they use - then later on you can identify these kinds of animals on other boards. I'd like to thank many of you for making me wiser over the last 12 months.. shorts included.

Friends.. If you are interested to know what is happening in our world .. then look at this . Our Water ... Then look at how many companies are getting involved in desalination. 2/3 of the world is covered in water. To remove the salt requires 1 kw/h per m3. Look at what they are planning. Oil and gas /energy is going to be more valuable to our world. Renewables take up so much land. In fact it will mess up farming and phosphates too. Of course I'm happy for anyone to argue this topic. I'm also invested in phosphates...
The only thing that will be free is air.. but then again .. who knows what is coming!

Taking every uptick as an opportunity to sell before the public share offering . Did the same with CLSN. A 20% drop will take us well below $2.
##############################
##############################
It would not surprise me to see TELL in the green by the closing. The dip is probably due to people who think they are so smart by cashing it in when they bought below $2. It's alright i guess. I am all for profit but holding out will be more profitable. Tax wise and mental wise too. Imagine you have to sit around hoping for the stock to go up so you can sell for a 10 - 15% percent profit? That's just insane.
##############################
##############################
Today I stashed 62,200 shares of TELL. Commodities are going UP, natural gas is going UP, the company is doing good job trying to survive and they may not need to issue shares. This company will be cheap when NG rise. 3.5usd is a good price! Bears may be right so I give them my respect!

It would certainly seem that at this point in time, it would be a good idea to take a good hard look at the issues at hand with an eye towards focusing on trying to find an overall understanding of the circumstances of the matter in which we presently find ourselves, so that in order to move forward from here we and our children and grandchildren and their grandchildren and future generations who share this planet with integrity, central to the matter, in the course of impacting and not acting too soon, because this is not the time, it's too early and we have to guard against special interests and elitists and crony capitalism while you and I and our families seek answers and ultimately the American people won't be fooled and it'll be the hugest, biggest, best, I'll tell you that and everyone's saying it and thousands of people tell me every day, ‚ÄúDonald, what the hell are you doing?‚Äù and you won't believe it, nobody can believe it because it's never been done before and it all comes down to working hard and not giving up and then one thing leads to another and nature takes its course and above all let's not jump to conclusions and

I have a proposal. If on Monday and Tell is down because according to Mariana and I quote "Will see a huge drop on monday" If this comes to fruition then we all have to stop bad mouthing Mariana and start listening to what she says. However if Tell is up on monday then Mariana should shut her pie hole and stop spewing false info and get lost and perhaps sell all of her 2735 shares of TELL and just leave the board. DEAL?

I think we'll be at $1.30 by end of next week. That being said, I think the odds are heavily in my favor given the fact they've been "in discussions" regarding (FID) for four years and still nothing. Smart money is pulling out of the Market to wait out the coming #$%$ storm as well. The timing couldn't be any worse for poor Tellurian. Don't you think those on the world stage of energy know full well about Souki Charif's Tellurian LNG venture? They all know and yet no one's come to the table? I can't help but feel there's something Charif's not telling us. To add insult to injury, TOTAL is selling and no longer obligated to file. So we won't even know, it'll just keep dropping. When the SP gets to a level where I feel the juice is worth the squeeze .... I'll buy.

When you read articles you have to remember the reporters need to keep their jobs so they have to be careful what they say to keep in line with what their fraternity masters are happy about.
By 2045 where most of the targets have been set for zero carbon, the ones who promised it will most likely be dead, so they don't care about failed promises. The next generation will have to pick up their nonsense and deal with it.

Don't forget. Most people like me are retail. The Nasdaq as AM and PM trading. If I had full access to all trading times, maybe I would day trade. Since I don't, it is extremely dangerous Many of these shorts have access at all times. Something can go terribly wrong if you are retail investing and jump out , thinking you can get in at a cheaper price later.. Take a look today at Benitec Biopharma Inc for example.. Today it is rallying in PM .. That is very unfair for retail investors. There is no way I will be taking these chances.. I'm locked and loaded... and keeping my Tell shares in the vault..

I see Total is starting a new LNG plant to supply Singapore for electrical generation. So disappointing that they sold 4.1mm shares of Tellurian in last 10 days. They bought that position at around $10 per share and still own 37mm shares.
Total has been a Tellurian believer and a big LNG believer. So unfortunate that they are steady sellers.

Half the people on this channel don't care about; statistics, trends, charts, macro, balance sheet, cash flow or any kind of fundamentals. They are 100% invested LONG in the hopes of a financial investment decision. A decision that has been on the table for over 4 years and hasn't happened, but it's gonna magically happen now when the stock market is on the verge of collapse, banks are tightening up lending and economies are in the toilet. They do not care that it's trending down with no sign of reversal at the moment. It's irrelevant. They will wait until the guy in the track suites speaks hanging on to every word while they hang on with "diamond hands" to under a dollar ...... again. In fact , they won't read anything unless falls in line with their own bias. Einsteins, all of them.
