Chinese education companies GSX, Tal Education, New Oriental plunge on reports of new on-line regulations
Mar. 26, 2021 11:23 AM ETGSX Techedu Inc. (GSX)By: Josh Fineman, SA News Editor
Chinese online tutoring company GSX Techedu (NYSE:GSX) plunged 20%, while Tal Education (NYSE:TAL) fell 18% and New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU) dropped 21% following report of new policies on on-line education.
Education industry magazine School Principle Reference earlier reported on some new on-line education educations policies that include banning on-line education for students age 6 and below, according to a Jefferies note.
In addition, on-line education companies will no longer be able to advertise on Chinese state-owned media.
Jefferies expects that the new policies will have "insignificant impact" on TAL and EDU as the companies' on-line products "very rarely" target pre-elementary school students.
##############################

TAL Education is up 10.77% to 39.40

Chinese education stocks are roaring back, TAL EDU FEDU. FEDU Is a small stock and is very undervalued @ $1.41. It should easily go up to $2. This is an after school program for students at Shanghai. The stock has very low debt. With the reopen this stock should do well.
##############################
##############################
TAL Education is down 7.74% to 48.01

Ponzi schemes never rely on logic but on people's greed. In China, most of the internal fraud is related to the fabrication of expenses or shady deals with suppliers for kickbacks, since the person who committed fraud can get cash easily. Never heard of anyone who inflated sales by himself or herself. The gain is not immediate or significant, and the risk is enormous. Originally coming from China, I am amazed that so many people are invested in these Chinese IPOs with no competitive advantage, no profit, and very little real presence in the Chinese market.
##############################
##############################
Since 2011, the company has invested about 253 projects.
Especially since 2014, an average of about 25 projects have been invested each year, and most of them are financial investments.

Online service rapidly grows increasing the marketing management expenses, and growth rate is gradually weakening due to money-burning competition.

In addition, some early-invested projects may face a decline in valuation.

conclusion: the company is losing money and the price shall go down to around 30 soon.

Someone is holding these shares up at $52, but I doubt they can hold back the sellers today like they did yesterday.

It seem to me that the quarter report was pretty bad. BUT, the stock is up more than 2% in the pre-market. Am I missing something?

##############################

##############################
##############################
I am wondering: who is buying TAL shares today, after the company announced an accounting scandal? We all know this company's valuation is HIGHLY STRETCHED. Why buy a stock of a highly-overvalued company with an accounting scandal in an overall bear market, with TAL's stock price only <15% down from its peak?
##############################
##############################
Can we see 36 today?
##############################
##############################
TAL warned on their revenue for next quarter, and guided lower. Then today, the Jefferies analyst downgraded the stock, with a 12 month price target of $33. The stock is up 3%, so what am I missing?
##############################
##############################
Tal is done for will slowly bleed until one day news hits like Luckin and it will gap down 70%

There is literally no upside
Classes canceled
Enrollment way down
Education world is changed for the next 1-2 yrs

MAYBE this is the move that We have waited for !
##############################
##############################
After doing some research, I decided to buy LEAP puts. My only fear isn't IF this scam is exposed, it’s WHEN it does what can one expect to experience by being short or having puts on this. Can anyone tell me what will happen to the puts that are in the money or shorts if/when this gets halted and/or delisted. Thanks in advance
##############################
##############################
If TAL reports 5% of their revenue as fraudulent and 4% is the profit margin, this company is not profitable and is actually losing money!
##############################
##############################
Why is anyone buying this today after they released that they have been fraudulently pumping up revenue? I understand getting in it for a day trade but this is crazy. Accounting fraud means sell 100% of the time. Maybe I’m wrong who knows.
##############################
##############################
The only news about this stock is from lawyers wanting to sue them, but it gets no downgrade and stellar performance!
##############################
##############################
Interesting that the stock would be down over 1% on extremely bullish news about a major investment in the company. I think I'll add shares on this dip.
##############################
##############################
I noticed that they posted that they will have UNaudited financial results out the end of July. What's up with that???
##############################
##############################
Is it the time to short this stock? The stock price $ 47 and market cap $37.8 billions don't make sense at all.
##############################
##############################
How does an after-school tutoring company grow from $6.00 per share to $47 per share within an 18 month period ? TAL tutors specialized in home economics, like "book cooking" !!!
##############################
##############################
TAL is a scam, the earnings result are not even audited and they just came up with some numbers not to scare the shareholders. I don't trust most of these chinese companies when it comes to their earnings.
##############################
##############################
Is it normal that a 32 billions company has no news for the last couple of weeks? I mean, they have several activities going on, i.e., the education through the internet, the new challenges imposed by the pandemic, etc. Nothing. The only new is just a long list of lawyers who are trying to sue the company on behalf of their customer!
##############################
##############################
The 3-4% fabricated revenue although looks small, but it will affect the earning in a big way, it will cut the earning in half. Because the fabricated number does not reduce the cost. The company may have to restate their
earnings.
##############################
##############################
This is going to hit 20$ soon the question is when. I have been fighting with myself trying to decide if this happens before mid May and I just don’t see how they can get away with it for much longer.. any thoughts?
##############################
##############################
What are some predictions for TAL, this month, this year, and then foreseeable future.

- Month - We come close to pushing $0.40 but will likely find the $0.375 resistance.
- Year - There is a very high chance this could breach $0.70 this year, but speculation has it in the mid $0.60’s
- Beyond - With the reserves in the ground, the facility in place, and the management team on staff this should be a multi billion dollar company; so TAL will go to $2-5 easy over the next several years.

If Petrotal #TAL #PTAL #PTALF gains some attraction and hype, it could certainly reach these numbers much sooner!

For those who are saying that the accounting fraud is "small", you have just not done your homework.

They admitted on Tuesday that 3-4% of their revenue is fake. Doesn't sound like much right? Well their profit margin is 3.29%. Their income for the last 12 months was $106 million but they just admitted to almost $150 million in fake revenue with no adjustment in costs. So their entire profit for the last year was fake (plus more on top of that). And if they want to spread this out over 3 years, they are still going to have restate 3 years worth of earnings and admit to almost a 50% drop in earnings for those years. Doesn't sound like a small thing now, does it?

As a thought experiment, think about what would happen if Amazon one day said 4% of their revenue was fake (with no adjustment in costs). They have a profit margin of 4% and a profit of $115 Billion. If they one day said 4% of their revenue was fake due to fraud, their stock would drop over 50% as TAL should, because not only have they lied about $115 Billion, but all trust would be lost in them.

TAL has been fraudulently overstating its profits since at least FY2016 including many frauds they have not admitted to yet. Here's a detailed video on TAL by legendary short seller Carson Block who predicted the collapse of Luckin Coffee: . He says TAL is the largest Chinese scam by market cap in history. Read his wiki . He exposes the fact that TAL twice acquired companies they had just "spun off" for the purposes of massively inflating their revenue by 100s of millions. Yes, they fraudulently reacquired their own assets, without disclosure, while at the same time artificially inflating the value of them. It's a classic technique for fraud used by Enron! Carson Block has a steller record (near 100% success rate) exposing Chinese scams: .

For those who believe TAL's bullsh*t story that the fraud was due to the actions one low-level employee, I can't believe how naive you are. Here's a quote from another poster:

"Ponzi schemes never rely on logic but on people's greed. In China, most of the internal fraud is related to the fabrication of expenses or shady deals with suppliers for kickbacks, since the person who committed fraud can get cash easily. Never heard of anyone who inflated sales by himself or herself. The gain is not immediate or significant, and the risk is enormous. Originally coming from China, I am amazed that so many people are invested in these Chinese IPOs with no competitive advantage, no profit, and very little real presence in the Chinese market."

Not only is it absurd that one employee would do this, since there is no incentive for them to, do you really believe that one employee could fake $150 million in revenue over a period of years without a single person noticing? Where there is smoke, there is fire. I feel TAL stock will fall 80%+ before this is all over.
##############################
##############################
After doing some early research, I figured out why the stock is down in pre-market: All Chinese education stocks are getting pummelled in pre-market: EDU, BEDU, RYB and TAL. Of course TAL has other major issues to contend with, including slowing revenue growth and the accusation of fraud by Muddy Waters research group. I'm still trying to find out why the other Chinese education stocks are down.

The after-school-tutoring business in China has exploded, as early as kindergarten, they are putting kids into these programs.

Only about 35% of students in grades kindergarten through high school go to after-school-tutoring programs, compared with about 80% in South Korea. So there is a lot of room to grow!

The top 50 universities in China accept only 28% of applicants. The after-school-tutoring business is a must if you want to get in.

Just saying.

From their current 20F (Annual report) just out this morning:
We have been named as a defendant in a putative shareholder class action lawsuit that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation.
We will have to defend against the putative shareholder class action lawsuit described in “Item 8. Financial Information—A Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information—Legal and Administrative Proceedings—Litigation,” including any appeals of such lawsuit, should our initial defense be successful. We are currently unable to estimate the possible loss or possible range of loss, if any, associated with the resolution of this lawsuit. In the event that our initial defense of this lawsuit is unsuccessful, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any appeal. Any adverse outcome of this case, including any plaintiff’s appeal of the judgment in this case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurance carriers will cover all or part of the defense costs, or any liabilities that may arise from these matters. The litigation process may utilize a significant portion of our cash resources and divert management’s attention from the day-to-day operations of our company, all of which could harm our business. We also may be subject to claims for indemnification related to these matters, and we cannot predict the impact that indemnification claims may have on our business or financial results.

China's university entrance exam directly determines which universities students can go to, it almost determines whether they will become blue-collar or white-collar workers later in their lives.

Most Chinese parents believed that starting earlier than others is the key to succeed in China, most of them spend unbelievably amount of money on an after-school tutoring for their kids.

Beijing-headquartered TAL, the biggest after-school tutoring services provider in China, has teaching centers in 36 cities across China with nearly 4 million offline students and over 35 million online registered users.

Qian Chen's article published on CNBC on June 7, 2018 told detailed stories ---

Shares are being accumulated the past few days...on the downside. Down volume is considerably higher than up volume. Even though the stock has been up marginally the past couple of days, shorts continue to accumulate. It doesn't matter how much revenue growth this company may have going forward, this is now about whether or not you can trust the company. If they have to restate earnings, which I think they will, that's only the first shoe to drop. How can you trust a company like this, after they restate financials? You can't, because there are too many other public companies to invest in that are honest, and no one wants to risk capital on a company with headline risk going forward, not in this volatile market.

I am trying to make different voice here:
1. after school tutoring is a huge market in China, middle-class families are willing to invest tonnes of money/resources into their kids' education to gain an edge. Tutoring services offered by TAL have a good reputation among parents.
2. Muddy water research shorted another Chinese Education stock EDU back in a few years ago for the same reason; cook book. EDU's stock halved in two days and it takes a year to recover the stock price for EDU. EDU had become a 10-time stock now. (EDU was also audited by Deloitte ).

TAL has chosen to "Ostrich" the financial accusations, which has been great strategy as stock hovers around 39 when it should be at 22-23 after being overly punished by investors when they finally OPEN THEIR EYES on this company.
##############################
##############################
I'm surprised whatever analysts cover this company haven't come out with downgrades yet. I'm sure they will. Meanwhile, TAL was overvalued even before this fraud surfaced. I think when the dust settles (defined as two weeks or less) I think TAL will be trading in the low $40's, and eventually back to the $30's.

##############################
For those claiming it will go to $20, $10, or maybe $1 like $LK, that is a complete joke and if you're short you're likely to get burned. This is nothing like $LK. This news was about a sales person inflating his own sales figures not the COO of the company like $LK. Another thing to consider is this was in a business unit that accounts for 3-4% of total revenue, so the total sales inflation could be much less than 3-4%; versus $LK where sales were inflated 70%.

I got in after hours yesterday at $42/share, feel pretty confident I will make some $$ at open. Good luck to all!
##############################
##############################
There is only 1 explanation for the spike up this morning. The explanation is, that there's NO explanation. It's a technical move, based on the previous day's candle, with a short covering spike early on. I do expect the stock to be faded throughout the day. It's possible the market makers needed some shares to facilitate what will probably be a substantial drop in PPS by next week. Just my take.
##############################
##############################
Some quick facts to help you decide your investment in $GSX:

1. Last week we have seen lots of manipulation in the stock price. MarketCap management/manipulation is a long time tradition in China Market now this comes to US. So don't expect this will come down anytime soon, unless there is some catalyst. ( @SEC) Also, the large amount of short float makes any manipulation fairly easy.

2. Board members of $GSX, at the same time, serve on the board of $TIGR, which is the broker forced users to cover their short positions last week. $TIGR also work closely with $IBKR. Also, one of the board member is the CFO of $BILI.

3. One of the firms invested in their Pre-IPO round, Gaorong Capital, also invested in PDD and HUYA.

4. Larry Xiangdong Chen is a billionaire, ex-EDU member, left $EDU cuz had conflicts with the founder of $EDU, Minhong Yu, who is well-respected in China. He also once served on the board of $PUXIN.

5. A random user on Twitter claiming "I will push GSX to $100", "Dont forget it's me who squeezed your short position" is actually Yongqiang Qian, Billionaire, Ex-$EDU, Ex-$DATE, a close friend of Larry Chen. He actually owns a hedge fund in Singapore, called QQQ capital.

6. Larry has the trust of CCP.

7. Those ppl, along with those PE giants behind them, are a gang. Also Smart, and Extremely Wealthy.

Personally I think this is 100% fraud and I feel shameful for them. I know China's online education scene very well and GSX is Mr.Nobody. The big players are $TAL and $EDU. However, with the amount of $$$$ behind GSX, the squeeze will also be painful, so choose wisely, hedge your shorts, good luck with trade.

About 6 months ago, a very famous training school closed up shop and ran with all the money. They never refunded tutions, nor did they pay staff. Look it up Web International English. The whole industry is contracting. Stay away from this one

What do You all think about the dozens of law firms that are already lined up to get $$$$$$
from these guys ? Dollars of losses against
cents of earnings. Could be/should be A LOT !

SEC SERVER CRASHES DUE TO HUGE FLOOD OF REPORTS BEING FILED ABOUT TAL https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8d89e882-04a7-3c9a-86c3-d37065f2e98e/tal-education-shares-slide-9-.html
##############################
##############################
Counted 27 Law Firms with.class action suits against TAL. It would seem logical that they
have substantial proof that their suits are with merit. Guessing also that Muddy will give a second statement. The price is just above support. A move a dollar lower should snowball. Wonder why the SEC has been mute on this. I am betting that they get “their due”.
##############################
##############################
Wow... TAL just appointed a new CTO today? Seems fishy because LK appointed two new independent board members just a few trading days before the investigation was announced 🤔
##############################
##############################
Manipulation ?? Do you think ? This thing is being manipulated big time, especially today and likely tomorrow and the next day. This company cannot afford to see its stock price sink as the Chinese markets melt down and the yuan continues to be devalued. Couple this with Muddy Waters Report and there are a triumvirate of reasons for insiders and key players to manipulate this stock....While this could be a hugely criminal enterprise, the SEC treats these Chinese national firms entirely differently than their US contemporaries. This is the problem with whistleblowing a Chinese national firm - they operate with almost impunity in the US. Sino Forest was easy "no trees: no company". TAL may ultimately be exposed, but buy your shorts with a long expiration date...
##############################
##############################
overpriced - the same like before ...
##############################
##############################
LK = TAL
##############################
##############################
come on bear camp. who's covering? big drop coming into the twenties. everyone one the board agrees.
##############################
##############################
I was an investor in TAL for years and made a ton of money but with these results i am going to sell the rest of my shares and maybe will rebuy at $10 again... We will see...
##############################
##############################
TAL already has a market cap of $23 B - for me with this business model not justified...
##############################

How does a Chinese Co get a P/E that is over a 100. When things are righted will be 10 P/E On
“Adjusted” correct earnings that are 20%
LOWER. SINLE DIGIT PRICE !!!
##############################
##############################
67% average EPS growth, 64% average Revenue growth. Impressive growth.
TAL is undervalue!

Below is a link to Tal's English site with the newest quarterly report. Some highlights
TAL Education Group Announces Unaudited Financial Results for the First Fiscal Quarter Ended May 31, 2018
- Net Revenues up by 71.1% Year-Over-Year
- Income from Operations up by 160.3% Year-Over-Year
- Net Income Attributable to TAL up by 132.0% Year-Over-Year
- Total Student Enrollments up by 88.7% Year-Over-Year
A strong quarter but they low balled their guidance so this may be the cause for the 11% haircut. They stated their guidance is subject to change.
##############################
##############################
Robbing hype from peter to pay paul, or from TAL.V.
TAL has suffered negative hype, while GTE is benefiting. Just wait until the curtain is removed and the real winner is exposed; #TAL.V
##############################
##############################
TAL Education is up 6.83% to 57.53
##############################
##############################
You are next TAL, China hustle bye bye
##############################
##############################
I'm with yeah john b, I think Mr. Block is waiting to deliver the death blow, hes probably a pretty good poker player
##############################
##############################
Wait, didn't they issue a revenue warning with this report? I read that their revenue guidance is light, and yet the stock is up over 17%?
##############################
##############################
No news for almost one month from this company. Except missed earnings and lawyers wanting to sue it. I mean, is normal that a 32 billion company leaves for weeks its investors without saying anything? No sign that they are still alive. As far as I can remember, It is almost a word-record and I don't think that it is a good sign.
##############################
##############################
any update from the company to dispute ?
##############################
##############################

Reported Fraud in their financials, loss a bunch of money, offering of almost a Billion, and the stock goes up? Hhmmm Are they manipulating this stock with that money? These companies are soooo corrupt!
##############################
##############################
I will wait for this to go under 5 like lk.
##############################
##############################
Traders may be missing the point regarding TAL. Some have said that TAL Education's fraud report only effects about 5% of their revenue. Is that why the stock price hasn't dropped into the $40's yet? In other words, are traders saying, hey 95% of TAL's revenue is Ok, only 5% is as a result of the fraud? Fraud is fraud, I don't think it matters how much revenue is involved, the point is can you trust this company going forward?
##############################
##############################
I would get out. IQ looks questionable too
##############################
##############################
TAL reached a new All Time High at 39.79
##############################
##############################
When people see this stock under 30 looking at their holdings this weekend ...WoW !!!!!!
##############################
##############################
This is an obvious fraud, however, it is perpetuated by the Chinese government who is presently leaning on the US to help them save Chinese phone maker, ZTE. They cannot have TAL nosedive and ruin these relations - expect slow precipitous slide with some resistence....

Pretty strong in this 44-46. Someone big is covering so many shares. I was hoping it will go below 40
##############################

I am not sure about TAL. Would wait for earnings...

TAL is going to end under $40 today. Really bad news about that investigation

Breaks 38. Not much support. In other words :DOWN. Co has said really nothing defending themselves.

##############################
##############################
anybody have a MudWat update? they seemed to be wrong about TAL accounting malfeasance!
MudWat issued a similar report on EDU in 2012. Stock fell 40% overnight and wound up ~$10 (half its value gone). It recovered and in Jan 2018 peaked at ~$100. EDU trades about $60 today. I believe it is a very similar business to TAL.
After some early success with cross data analysis to root out Chinese accounting fraud, Mud seems to have lost it. I am sure its short-holders still made money hand over fist, despite Mud's wrong malfeasance assertions!
##############################
##############################
Instead of sticking with $CVE, I recommend you guys hold $TAL.V and $FEC for now. The former oil company has very decent net backs in the industry ! And the latter one is a very undervalued company for now, looks VERY promising in 2021! Both worth holding for years !! 😎 don’t be regret and say I didn’t tell you at that time !

avoid this stock if you can, read the news about accounting fraud. if you want a Chinese education stock $NEW had it's IPO last week
##############################
##############################
If Carson is correct in his comparison to Enron, then I would expect TAL to trade in the low $20's within a few days or a week or two. Traders tend to shoot first and ask questions later. I had just begun my trading career while Enron was still trading. The stock fell every day, 15-20% until it was trading close to zero.

Today seems like it has the potential to crash the markets. The news in Turkey has potentially devastating consequences for the markets. Since TAL already has it's problems with slowing revenue and serious accusations of fraud, the downside effect on the stock price could be substantial. I blame Trump for most of the market carnage, for a lot of reasons too many to mention here.
##############################
##############################
So obvious. Short seller attack. Fake felonious news, paid press with crony lip service.
Full court press coming, covering eminent. it's the new futility for short fundies.

For developing countries, $FEC and $TAL are two very undervalued energy company, better than GeoPark. You will thank me after 6 months.
##############################
##############################
TAL is overvalued... PT 15$
##############################
##############################
For this stock the valuation is too high... The PE is over 50! A correction to a PE around 35 would be more than justified.. The Price target would be around 27 $
##############################
##############################
Another no debt oil company is $TAL.V -> Petrotal, this is a 500%+ potential stocks.
##############################
##############################
But truth be told . . . just booked my 20%+ profits from last night. Bird in the hand, and all that rot. But longer term, TAL is a terrific buy at these levels. TAL was 59.50 on March 4th, so for all you buy-'n-holders, TAL is a buying opportunity at these prices. (And, whoever said that it was a cheatin' salesperson v. the CFO/COO is correct. Really quite TRIVIAL. We know corporate malfeasance . . . and THIS ain't it, bros 'n ho . . . !!

Traveler, ever travel to china?, Asia? Corruption is the norm, even expected. Prvate education is highly competitive, with low margin, high student turnover...and no barrier to entry. Traditionally, the teachers are the big talent. Tal is just a roll-up of existing schools , so wheres the organic growth? School business is nothing new in asia...oh did i mention corruption, bribes for teachers from pre-k to post grad. are a tradition, and that tradition is embedded in the upper mgmnt. You will nevr ever get the transparency of western comp. ...the comparison to Enron is valid, performance at all cost is expected
##############################
##############################
TAL is super expensive. Buy a value stock FEDU. It’s at Shanghai, and it is an after school program company. It
traded 0.59 Price/book. It has about $2 cash and it’s trade $1.2. SO MUCH CHEAPER THAN TAL and EDU.

as I said long time ago: the best way to check if A Chinese listed firm has tendency to cook the books is: its founders' background of education: if they obtained their degree from USA or not: if yes, the chance of cooking books is low; otherwise, be careful!

My sister has been a teacher in China for years and has always complained her students never get any real time off because so many of them enter summer school programs. I checked and sure enough the best earnings of the year fgor Tal come after the summer earnings report because they have most of their full time students then. I'm going to buy as much as I can because I think this is going to be a huge earnings beat after the stock split a few months ago. Paul

Why isn't this down $5? Traders, this is a fraud. They just announced yesterday that someone working for the company was artificially inflating revenue numbers.

This is just the beginning.....a year from now China will be exposed! You have to wonder how the most populated country in the world with 1,433,783,686 citizens remains silent. It has always been this way. Chinese are brain washed at an early age, how? Chinese culture is very tolerant of child abuse. It's highly unlikely that you'll ever see a Chinese preschooler have a tantrum. Watch how they interact in society with almost now emotions. Reminds me of that line from the movie Godfather, keep your friends close but your enemies closer.

I posted yesterday to short the #$%$ out of this on purpose. They have brushers watching all social media boards, ect and when they see these posts they report it and this happens the next morning or at the end of that day. Its bizarre how those fraud PRC are doing this to these stock on purpose to make $millions. Its abuse and totally illegal. Those brushers that are watching this good luck in JAIL. Its illegal in China and the US. And note I was just kidding about shorting this POS stock. **Kids in China and elsewhere want one on one tutoring thats why you keep losing money. Nobody wants your fake large classes that aren't even full. You were busted already for fraud and im sure you made up fake accounts like GSX.... here come the brushers watching this post. Oh no go tell those idiots in China I said this.

TAL likely put in some kind of top today. Pullback to $25-26 would be normal and healthy. Lets see
##############################
##############################
They are trying to hold it back.Every time it gets a run somebody is loading the ASK.
##############################
##############################
by the number of the students, the grow rate is 100%, although the net income did not grow the same percentage, I think they use money for expand, each student will stay with the school for few years, could be 12 years. when they open a new school, all the other school get nervious, since they are very attractive. also, they train the teacher a lot , more than edu, they control the teaching quality.
##############################
##############################
I think TAL is due for a pullback. What are your thoughts? Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesomestock-s.
