My opinion,
Investing in gold miners was better than investing in gold over the last 50 years.
Investing in oil companies was better than investing in oil over the last 50 years.

Investing in crypto miners will be better than investing in crypto over the next 50 years. I'm in for the long term.

For everyone that says Hut 8 is not an undervalued gem... I have presented to you the FACTS that Hut 8 is a Fundamentally sound company and the NASDAQ uplist should help fix these valuation mistakes from Mr.Market

Hut 8 Trailing P/E ratio 8.14 with 3K Bitcoin hovering around a $500 million market cap

Riot Trailing P/E ratio = N/A because they have reported negative earnings TTM (over last 12 months) with ONLY 1K Bitcoin and 2 billion market cap

Marathon Trailing P/E 24.29 with 5k Bitcoin at a $2billion market cap (low key impressive let's not hate)

So in all reality

Riot is OVERVALUED
Marathon is Fairly valued
Hut 8 is SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERVALUED

Disclaimer: I am long HUTMF and I have an OPEN SHORT position in Riot and may open a long position in MARA in the next few weeks not sure yet.

$RIOT $MARA $HUTMF

riot and mara are better trades than hive and argo. hive and argo cheaper but have bigger floats. mara and riot lower floats. they can move fast. just structure makes them better stocks. argo and hive interesting too. not too sure about how they will grow bc they are pennies.

I have 400 shares at $38.50. What shall I do?
##############################
##############################
What to expect in the coming 3 weeks:

First, $BFARF gets the DTC approval. At that point, $BFARF will announce their listing date for NASDAQ. That sends the stock up.

Second, $BFARF releases earnings. I believe the HODL vs forward guidance could be a wash, or maybe even a positive, given their Q1 HODL is only around 1,000 coins. Remember, $HUTMF went down after earnings because of the looming loss in Q2 for their HODL (3,000 coins). Further, the announcement for listing should mitigate $BFARF's negative HODL for Q2 and possibly accentuate the positive forward guidance.

Third, next Friday, Bitcoin begins a leg up. Should be good for SP of all miners.

Fourth, the week after this coming week, $BITF actually lists on the NASDAQ. So, what should we expect?

Roughly, the quick and dirty valuation is always $RIOT, because they have the same forward guidance on hashrate (7.7 EH/s for $RIOT vs 8 EH/s for $BFARF). $BFARF was higher during the past 4 months, but $RIOT will be higher going into the end of 2021. Then $BFARF overtakes $RIOT by the end of 2022. Call it a wash.

So we divide $RIOT's market cap by $BFARF's (1.9B/.662B = 2.87). Multiply that by current share price of $4.16 = $11.94. (Note, this takes into account the PP.) I know that seems low, but Bitcoin is low and so are $RIOT and $BFARF.

That valuation is based on current prices for both stocks beat to a pulp. If RIOT goes up by 50% to $34.26, their market cap would be $2.9B. A 50% increase = a SP of $6.24 for $BFARF, and its market cap would be $.993B. Divide the two market caps and we get a multiple of 2.93. BITF's fair-valued SP would be $18.28.

That gives us a range from $12 to $18, depending on what Bitcoin/$RIOT are doing. It could go a little lower, but it could go a lot higher.

So, what will Bitcoin be doing? My best estimate is that it languishes until Thursday/Friday, building out the bottom of the teacup, and then begins its upward ascent for June. I believe the high-speed trading algorithm for miners is more influenced by where Bitcoin is in its monthly cycle than the actual price of Bitcoin. That is, when investors believe Bitcoin has bottomed, they start buying miners. When they think Bitcoin is topping out, they start selling miners. That explains why some days Bitcoin is up (towards the end of a run), but miners are down - it's just too close to a perceived top, so investors sell miners even though Bitcoin is having a good day.

If, indeed, Friday begins the June run, all miners should be going up, nicely. Hopefully, before $BFARF lists, $RIOT is up 50%. That puts $BITF in the top of my range. If $RIOT goes even higher, then so does $BITF.

The other variables. Well, there is just too much to consider. Traders will sell at different points, shorts will short at different points, retail will buy at different points, and Institutions will buy at different points. All the while, there will be gaps to fill, so MMs will be walking it up and down.

It may take three weeks for $BITF to hit its peak, but that's not so bad.

So, where does that leave investors?

Well, it's not a crapshoot - so that's good.

We know the price of $RIOT (miner's reflection of Bitcoin) is our most important metric, and we have a range of values based on that metric.

We know $RIOT tends to bounce back hard, and if the past is any indicator, Bitcoin should be on an up-swing, so both factors bode well for the top of our range.

Whatever happens, it's going to be interesting going into Friday and lots of fun, after Friday.

Anyway, that's my 2 cents - Good luck to all.

38 million dollar mark to market losses

If BTC ends Q1 at 33 K, roughly current price , the 1565 BITCOINS on the books at March 31- BTC at 57 K
will net a mark to market loss of around 38 Million. ( 57 K -33 K , 24 K spread times 1565- 37.56 million loss)

IF RIOT can mine around 700 bitcoins Q2 , income from operations could be about 10 million based on Q 1 average of 46 K BTC.

Of course then these new 700 bitcoin marked down from 46 K to 33 K ( if Bitcoin were to close Q2 there)
would be another 9.1 million write down in value.

So 10 million good guy , 38 million bad guy , followed by another 9 million bad guy.

Just imagine if BTC at say 15 K at June 30 , wow another 40 million write down on top of this.

Surely you can see why I am so excited about the 12,000 shares I control to downside with puts.

Oh just a reminder, even if BTC somehow managed to skyrocket to 100 K, RUOT long term model ends in a few years when all bitcoin are mined out.

Said it before say it again,

RIOT has worst business model in history of all time.

When I called for the stock to be in the 20s, people here gave me thumbs down. I am not a short seller, I am losing big on this stock too. This stock may go down to the teens, I have not sold it yet because the damage is done to my wealth and I now treat it as speculation, not investment.
##############################
##############################
Market Cap Update:

$RIOT = 2.2B
$BFARF = .8017

2.2/.8017 = 2.744 = our multiple.

$BFARF SP = $5.035

Comparable SP on NASDAQ = $13.82.

That's a nice uptick from the previous $11.94.

We were up strong today (21.39%), now we need $RIOT (13.62%) to catch up.

Good luck.

It's going to be exciting to see how China's ongoing and planned BTC mining crackdowns are going to effect the network difficulty. Power-caps in Sichuan already resulted in hashrates plummeting by 20%, and headlines are reading "China to crackdown on #Bitcoin mining .. activities, vows Xi Jinping's right-hand man and Vice Premier Liu He." If difficulty drops by about as much as BTC prices have, profitability for miners like BitFarms (and to a lesser extent $RIOT, $MARA, $HVBTF & $HUTMF) may be preserved in the midst of this on-going corrective wave. When price fully rebounds, it can send revenues through the roof 😎

Fear is ruling the market. China is cracking down on bitcoin mining in their country, not ours. They are eliminating Riot's competition.

Public companies do private placements, issuing shares to institutional investors at reasonable prices in order to fund the capital investment needed to spur a companies growth. On the other hand, do you know what inflation is? Imagining increasing the quantity of the dollar supply without any sort of accretive investment. THAT is dilution, and the proof is in the pudding (ie., inflation rate increase.) Get this: BTC isn't going up, USD is going down. USD isn't less "down" today than it was a week ago when BTC was 60k and rising. The price decrease was triggered by information attacks by centralized forces devoted to concealing the extent of the dollar's devaluation. Think news releases by short-dominated firms, but on a wider scale, employing tools like Elon Musk and even heads of agencies like the dept of commerce and IRS. Point is, the driving force behind BTC's increasing value is still strong (or, the devalued/diluted global reserve currency) and so miners like $BFARF (soon to be $BITF and to a lesser extent, $RIOT, $HUTMF, and $MARA) are criminally undervalued given that they producing Bitcoin at a fraction of it's retail value, and storing them. There will NEVER be ANY dilution of Bitcoin beyond the planned total supply following the final halving event. This is a genuinely scarce resource and a legitimate store of value backed by true energy input (and the associated value of energy used) along with the value assigned by those who use it as a hedge against the devaluation of their nation's currencies. There's no reason to neglect not only adding as many BTC to our portfolios as possible, but stocking on shares of miners as well.. BitFarms is the largest miner in North America and uplists to NASDAQ Global in a week or so... By the EOY, their all-in cost to produce one unit of Bitcoin will be ~2,700 and they mined more BTC last year than both $RIOT and $MARA. This is bigger than $COIN and 12x's more valuable than buying Bitcoin from an exchange. Why buy chips when you could own the casino? This is our time. Forget $TSLA and it's head puppet. Pack your bags and let's experience the reality of the wealth of the wicked being laid up for the righteous. The wealth transfer has only just begun; get some.

Increased by 2x miners. By end of year, the hash increases by 5x.

During the three-month period ended March 31, 2021, Riot received 6,703 S19 Pro Antminers as per purchase contracts with Bitmain previously announced in 2020, resulting in a total of 13,746 miners deployed as of March 31, 2021.

Subsequent to March 31, 2021, the Company received a further 8,900 S19 Pro Antminers as per purchase contracts with Bitmain previously announced in 2020. When fully deployed, Riot’s fleet will increase to 22,646 miners with an estimated hash rate capacity of 2.3 exahash per second (“EH/S”).

During 2021, the Company entered into additional purchase agreements with Bitmain for the purchase of 43,500 Antminer S19j (90 Terahash per second) (“TH/s”) miners for a total purchase price of $145.7 million. Once fully deployed, Riot’s hash rate capacity is estimated to reach 7.7 EH/s in the fourth quarter of 2022

@Scott & real Joe ( not the one that's always doing Swan Lake) . Scott your post is why I love this board entertaining, thoughtful, intelligent & comical. ( Roger Ebert). I have been thinking this maybe the great "reset" - somewhat agreeing with you - but not sure if its time to go back in the water.

Bit had a solid evening - all the media outlets are saying its over, only one said it recovered ( usually honest news). Actually recovered well from the crash & Riot shook it off. Lots of manipulation.

Riots performance has been down since April 14th not due to Riot but Bitcoin was flirting with the highs of $64K.... too high too fast. Unstrained. Acting like a nervous cat. Resetting Bit May help in the month May.

Remember there's a little old lady who put her cat in the microwave it's thawing. Friday maybe the day- today watch & learn. Maybe up to $29.50 close at $26.

Flash Crash - Bitcoin

Feeling another Flash crash coming on.

Maybe over the weekend when liquidity is light, but hey maybe today,, could happen at any second no warning.

But anyone who does not have head in the sand knows it it coming.

This time BTC might probe 20 K.

It could end June 30 between 25 and 30 K.

Remember BTC closed March 31 around 57 K so this would mean about a 50 or 60 million losses on RIOT books

$MARA is the best ESG play for Bitcoin! Accumulate as much as you can at these prices.

“... we have now secured economical hosting arrangements for all 103,120 of our previously purchased Bitcoin miners,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s CEO. “This agreement sets us on a clear path to becoming one of the largest, most efficient, and most environmentally conscious Bitcoin miners in North America. Additionally, the structure of this agreement is highly advantageous as it allows us to have the necessary infrastructure for our miners built without the capital expenditure, and it provides us with the flexibility to explore alternative locations, should we require them, while mitigating the risk of price increases.

$RIOT isn't even close!

I honestly think shorts are going to be in world of pain in the next couple of months. This was over extended when it hit high 70s but after this much selloff and with BTC price still in $30Ks, for me, it is clear as day I should be buying here. I am already all in.

Weekend update for all of my $BFARF, $DMGGF, $HUTMF, $HVBTF, $MARA, and $RIOT Buddies and Buddettes.

Tip of the hat to all Canadian miners for closing in the GREEN, today – Wowser!

Tip of the hat to $DMGGF, $HVBTF, $MARA and $RIOT for posting such a strong comeback (double digit %).

Tip of the hat to $HUTMF for Applying to the NASDAQ.

Tip of the hat to $DMGGF and $ARBKF for signing “Crypto Climate Accord.”

NEWS: Amazingly, 200,000,000 North Americans were in line to purchase a Tesla this week, and 100% of them were planning to use Bitcoin, because the only people who can afford a car that might “burst into flames” are people who have been making money on Bitcoin and Bitcoin miners.

Alas, Elon Musk stopped taking Bitcoin. Of course, this sent the markets reeling. Apparently, the only way Bitcoiners would be able to resolve their guilt over “unclean energy” was to purchase an electric car. That was their trade-off for the environment. Now? No electric car for them! Nice move, Elon!

(In a side note, based on this quote from the Washington Post, “a growing number of fire incidents involving older Tesla Model S and X vehicles…” there is increasing concern about the company’s carbon footprint.)

In a related story, part of the above-mentioned “Crypto Climate Accord,” suggests converting flare emissions from burning Tesla’s into crypto-mining electricity. Elon had no comment!

In other news, $BFARF, the first Canadian Miner set to go to the NASDAQ, needs only to get approval from the DTC to trade stocks, electronically (novel idea). When approved, $BFARF will announce their listing date – hopefully next week! That earns them the “safest place for mining money” award next week.

Health update: My doctor has taken me off all anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications.

Wonderful!

Unfortunately, she now has me on anti-psychotics, because I am starting to hear voices – most notably, Elon Musk. Further, with him in my head, I am now paranoid my head will “burst into flames.”

No idea what is in store for next week. Now that I have a direct line to Elon, one would think I would be better informed. One thing he did share with me is his plan to replace air bags with sprinkler systems.

Suffice it to say – Good Luck to all and have a well-deserved GREAT weekend!

Bit is moving back up.... just be ready for a dump at 10:30 like Friday ( felt like manipulation)
##############################
##############################
Just watched a CNBC video on Bitcoin. Now wait, I know they have some bias, but it was quite interesting. It said that during the last crash it was the whales that came in and bought Bitcoin. This was different then earlier, so it shows that there are a lot of big money people behind it. I think the governments won’t care about it after they can figure out how to tax it. Just like gambling and dope, it was bad for you until the government could tax it. I was actually getting out (selling covered calls) but the price dropped and I still own the stock. If big money is sticking around I might also.

The evolution of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology will be highlighted at the four-day Coindesk (NASDAQ:COIN) Consensus conference. Speakers like the Fed's Lael Brainard, ARK Invest's Cathie Wood, MicroStrategy's (NASDAQ:MSTR) Michael Saylor and Bridgewater's Ray Dalio will have cracks at talking up or talking down Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD) and other cryptos. Brainard will speak at 8:00 a.m. and Dalio is on deck at 8:30 a.m. ~~~~~~ scheduled for monday all day.....
##############################
##############################
The daddy issues of people who idolized Elon Musk led to a severe (but brisk) price-drop, but as surely as the value of USD is going down, the value of BTC is in the process of going straight-up. The silver lining is, people's self-righteous hunger for opportunities to signal their virtue all but guarantees that upon their global uplisting, BitFarms' world-class 100% hydro-electric operation will get extremely hot extremely fast. After BTC's 25% mining difficulty surge, $BITF's industry leading hashrates and EOY .02/kWH ~45% cost cut may establish BitFarms head and shoulders above $RIOT & $MARA. With BTC expected to touch 200k this summer, the $BFARF/$BITF led Big 3 miners are all headed to the triple digits. Don't let the shakeout, the media machine, or the glorified shills distract you from the value of owning shares in mining companies during historic Bitcoin bull-runs. Where we're headed, you'll wish you brought your bags 😎⌛
##############################
##############################
We went down huge when BTC was at $60k, now BTC is dropping like a rock. Shorters think we will drop as BTC drops as well but it doesn’t work that way. The market is forward-looking. When you see that we are starting a slight uptrend when BTC are down huge, you know we’ve hit a bottom and the momentum are about to shift longterm.

Let’s fly! $CLSK $MARA $RIOT $SOS

Loool people think btc price down directly means a huge drop for mara. It’s going with the markets too. If the other growth stocks are green tomorrow, MARA could be green as well as $CLSK, $RIOT.

##############################
Shorts, if there really are any on here, are really pressing their luck shorting RIOT at 23. Better cover if you value your money. imho.
##############################
##############################
With Bitcoin now below 40k, I wonder how RIOT is gonna do tomorrow? Another green day?
##############################
##############################
Elon should like RIOT's focus on reducing energy consumption for mining or improved hashrate efficiency to 33 joules per terahash. I believe this makes RIOT the most efficient BTC miner.

"When fully deployed, the Company’s total fleet is expected to consume approximately 257.6 MW of energy with an overall hash rate efficiency of 33 joules per terahash (J/TH). This demonstrates Riot’s commitment to being a market leader by building one of the largest and most efficient Bitcoin mining fleets in the industry."
##############################
##############################
with btc down Nasdaq hardly up I'd be okay with any green days. let's see if we can close at 10 percent
##############################
##############################
RIOT mined 206 BTC which tells me they averaged a hashrate of just under 1.2 EH/s in April against the monthly average global hash rate of 173.22. We now know they ended April at 1.585 EH/s based on their latest PR which indicates that after they install the new 6500 Bitmain miners (+.715 EH/s), they will reach 2.3 EH/s before end of Q2, 2021. At 1.585 EH/s, they will mine a minimum of 255 BTC in May assuming none of the new 6500 miners get installed. Looks like strong continued growth in May and June as the new miners get installed.
##############################
##############################
RIOT pulled back after touching recent highs. RIOT should tag 28 to 30 today or tomorrow.
##############################
##############################
we go from 31 to 35 and longs calling for new all-time highs lol. that's rich. Until it recovers its primary trend line and 200 dma, both of which are at 40k, you guys have NOTHING to celebrate.

After it came out that Colonial Pipeline Hackers Received $90 million in Bitcoin, the media narratives against BTC may have only just begun. However, if hackers carelessly move that money, and the CIA and other departments of the US Gov't can somehow identify the culprits by utilizing the immutability of the blockchain, the incredible security of BTC could become front-page news. Plus, when it comes out that the largest BTC miner in North America is $BITF/$BFARF (not $RIOT or $MARA but a top-tier, extensively audited, 100% hydro-electric, undervalued mammoth) the popularity of Bitcoin can soar to new heights. I think the chart analyzers need to sit this one out, BTC could see a historic recovery this summer. Either way, so long as BTC is trading at 5 digits, BitFarms is making serious money. 📈
##############################

Bought in Yesterday and already feeling pretty good about it. Hopefully, it continues to rebound (somewhat) to its peak. If you look at the graph I would say It is quite bullish, praying it pans out for us! Not only does this graph look good, though. Overall it is a strong company and I see a lot of optimistic people in these forums, keep buying&holding.

Riot Earning is on Monday 10. May before the open.

Fundamentally, Riot Blockchain still has the makings of a growth stock after its amazing growth over this past year and the huge interest growth in cryptocurrency lately. The company is currently enterprise valued at $2.58 billion and has a forward price-earnings ratio of 17.15. Overall, Riot Blockchain stock is a great stock-based alternative to buying cryptocurrency directly for long-term believers of cryptocurrency growth.

For all you Einstein's..

Praising Riot for a great quarter,

Learn to read a financial statement first.

If it was so great , why is stock down 5 % premarket ?

Did you notice they consumed 6 million dollars in their operating activities ?

Could not even generate any cash from ops in the best quarter ever to be a bitcoin miner,.

Total disaster.

Issued 6 million highly dilutive shares and raised only 83 million from this,

Do the math , only raised around $13 a share in proceeds to company.

For the longs you just got incredibly diluted, don't you feel violated ?

You should.

Still plenty of people trying to catch the falling knife. Thus it probably has to fall longer/further. On most days recently, RIOT falls around 10%, ballpark. Painful. When people quit buying on the way down on this message board, then the bottom will probably be in. Does not appear to be anywhere near this level. I bought in a $26. I had no position before that. Plenty of pain already for me and probably plenty more. Hopefully I won't bail near the actual bottom, but there will likely be a lot more pain for bulls.

I just posted earlier that I thought we would fail at 40k and we did just that! With the backtest complete, btc is free to free fall from here. Are you guys paying attention? The dogefather goes on SNL which pumps btc to 59k thereby forming the top of the right shoulder. It subsequently collapses right afterward forming the right shoulder. Then he gets on twitter and trashes bitcoin and it breaks the neckline. Now after having plunged, he tweets which causes btc to rally and test (and fail) at its primary trend line and 200 dma.

With NASDAQ and the crazy Elon stuff during the weekend dropping BTC 5k+, was expecting a -15% in RIOT.

We'll see!

This can drop like a rock on Monday or go up like the moon on Monday. If bitcoin goes up during the weekend then it will go up with earnings report. People can spin it both ways.

Hi - RIOT is a 3x inverse ETF play for Bitcoin now.
##############################
##############################
Let me help. The earnings are a reflection of last quarter’s results. Bit was on a run up, so riot ran up. A stock’s price is a function of it’s future earnings, not the past. The sell was in April, before the news. Now it will fall as demand falls for bit. If you don’t get this, maybe stay off this high risk stuff. Best of luck.
##############################
##############################
People selling RIOT based on Elon Musk comment that he will not accept bit coin to purchase TESLA due to environmental issues which is not true means absolutely nothing with the future price of Bit Coin. He also said in the same tweet he will not be selling any Bit Coin. Yes there be a reaction in the stock but it will pass. I dont think FCC will like Elons comment if it affects the price of Bit Coin. This guy needs to get a muzzle wear it full time.
##############################

BTC dropping means more BTC to mine. When BTC rockets to $500,000, we’ll have more since we’re able to mine at lower hashrates now when people shut off their miners due to struggles with profitability.

Sold riot at 51 and recently at 25.75. I don't understand the business model. They mine crypto and that's all I know.

I'm all tapped out. What a great buying opportunity during this panic sell mode. I've been lucky to not "get trapped" in the downslide on RIOT except for today. Didn't see it coming. Okay since I planned to go long anyway. In between low to mid 20s. As I said before, I thought low to mid 20s is the bottom. I still believe that. We'll see.

Earnings

Longs and shorts,

Don't be surprised if RIOT absolutely crushes Q 1 earnings estimates- well of only 1 analyst- at 20 cents

Seems since they already posted how many mined and we know up 50 %, costs in Q1 should not be much higher and Bitcoin was off the charts high in Q1.

All this could lead to 40 to 50 cents earnings up 100- 150 % over the only analyst projection.

So why do I own so many puts.

Because - who cares-? Old news.

Its all about looking forward - collapse of BTC will reverse all earnings in q2 likely.

They are investing heavily and running up cost structure in a business guaranteed not to exist in just 5 to 10 years.

And everyone in on on the " secret" - especially insiders.

So yes big one time earnings and then expect a deluge of insider selling

##############################
##############################
I wouldn't be surprised if NASDAQ lists BITF just as the bullish break of BTC's present corrective pattern breaks, which could be imminent. At that point, we could potentially see a BitFarms move up to $MARA or $RIOT levels before entering a standard consolidation pattern. Depending on BTC's price at the height of the pattern (ie, 100k-200k), $BFARF/$BITF could realistically sit somewhere between $60-70 a share. If you've seen the size of past year end parabolic upward moves in mining stocks during BTC upwards breakouts, you know how conservative that number really is, but with MARA and RIOT having such a high volume established on NASDAQ, BitFarms may realistically remain chomping at their heels for a while (in spite of it's superior mining operation efficiency and hashrates). This is a good thing however as it's likely to continue an upward move even as the other mining stocks and BTC itself pulls back.. afterall, it's cost of mining is projected to decrease by 45% EOY as a result of the new .02/kwh rates at the Argentinian facility.

The panic starts as bitcoin drops to 38k. But think for one minute. The big boys bought at 60k and loved it. 38k they are jumping up n down with joy.

This is great......17% shave in AH. Just bought in at $21.99. This will retrace and be back up and over $30 by Friday. Thank you Elon!!!!
##############################
##############################
The other side of this bounce will be dramatic.
##############################
##############################
Picked up a few shares of RIOT due to the stock still being up appreciably from its prior low of 20.68 from last week when Bitcoin was still well above 40K!!!
##############################
##############################
O.k. either the new line is drawn in sand here or huge bear trap in AH over night.

Now riot seems to be 24. At bitcoin 44K
MARA 21.60 is at 44K
Following chart mirrors of bit and riot and mara..

If this is NOT a huge trap..
Than it's the new MM recalibration..like feb March april.. recalibration.

So a guide map might be starting to appear here.. IF so....
Than ALL IN.
If a trap... than no way..
So today was a watch n see..
Before any money goes in..

Enjoy

Plaintiff alleges that Riot began in the early 2000s as a biomedical company, attempting to develop a blood test for use in the diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis.

Defendants, acting as members of a group, participated in a “pump-and-dump” scheme.

CNBC reported that “as Riot was issuing press release after press release promising great plans for the company, Honig was selling, making millions of dollars along the way.” CNBC also reported that Honig “acknowledged,” in an interview with the news outlet, that “he’s done this before".

Been scaling in to May 21, June 18 and Dec 17 Calls.... Nice consolidation happened in Bitcoin, therefore $MARA & $RIOT too...
there may still be some volatility (trading opportunities) but for the Long Term, I am still Very Bullish and these Prices are a nice bargain imo..
##############################
##############################
Well another rough week, never thought we’d be happy with a 26 close. Earnings will probably not be that big of factor, but Bitcoin back to 56 would take us back to 40.
##############################
##############################
With bitcoin going down hard, I decided to sell RIOT. I think crypto currency days are numbered here in the US and in Europe as well. However the US government will create their own digital currency. It is being looked into now.
##############################
##############################
@Money riot does follow BTC. Today will be volatile for sure.

However after a major BTC drop (yesterday & past weeks), RIOT investors ( purchasers) are always cautious until BTC is stable & sustained. Similar to driving 82 MPH on the highway & nearly missing a car crash you tend to slow down & pump the brakes.

Until the sun comes out, you forget next thing you know you are doing 90 MPH.

What do you guys think of this strategy? At precisely 4:00am eastern on the dot, right when premarket trading starts, I will sell all of my RIOT shares for the most someone will by them from and then immediately open up a large short position? I would do these trades super fast having it all done by 4:02am. Do you think that would be a good move for me?

Why I bought EBON at $3 today 5/11/21:
1. Launched and operating one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia, the only that is run by a publicly-traded company;
2. TOP 3 Mining Rigs producers in China, likely in the world too;
3. Started mining Bitcoins, Altcoins and Dogecoins, largest Dogecoins miner in the world,
4. $300 Million USD cash raised in offering, ZERO Debt. Net Cash alone worth $2 a share.. one of the best balance sheets in the tech world as of now,
5. Bitcoins on the rise, estimated to reach 100K this year, Dogecoin skyrocketed, Ebon is the largest Digecoin miner,
6. Buy low, Sell high. My personal target $22.

people said they are glad they got in yesterday.. let's see 84.14M shares x 26.03 = 2.19 Billion market cap. 1771 bitcoin x 49500 = 87.6 M. If they double bitcoin by end of year and bitcoin goes to 100k then 3542 x 100000 = 354 million.. let's just say mining rigs are straight worth 650 million. 650 million + bloated price target of 354 million = 1 billion.. what in the jesus are you guys buying.

Bitcoins History ~~ Corrections are always met with Buyers:

2011 - Bitcoin soars from $1 in April to a peak of $32 in June. By November it's worth $2.
2013 - Starting the year at $13, Bitcoin jumps to $220 by April, only to change hands at $70 two weeks later. The crypto then climbs from $123 in October, to $1156 by December, then tumbles to $760 in three days.
2017 - Trading around $1K in January, Bitcoin reaches nearly $20K by the end of the year.
2018 - Prices steadily decline, eventually tracking back to the $3,500 level.
2019 - Bitcoin tops $10K again over the summer, but ends the year at $7K.
2020 - Dropping to a low of $5,200 as the pandemic set in, the crypto goes on to reach $30K.
2021 - Momentum picks up as Bitcoin breaches $40K, $50K and $60K, before the most recent crash.

Corrections are always met with buyers OR history repeats itself.......i just bought shares 24.90 ~~~~~

In about a week, RIOT will report its April mining numbers and I expect to see at least 255 BTC at their hash rare of 1.4 EH/s which should be higher now. At current BTC price of $57K, their gross revenue would be $14.5M. RIOT's 2020 gross revenue was $12M. Now generating more revenue in one month than all last year with a growth rate that will continue at this pace throughout the year as their hash rate grows even as difficulty rates will eventually rise.

To all the shorts out there, have fun while it lasts, this is highly oversold at this point. Not covering at this price will hurt really bad

Compare Elon’s behavior with two other figures who could rightly declare themselves king of something or other: Vitalik Buterin and Jack Dorsey. You might not even immediately connect Dorsey to crypto, but he made a huge splash by adding bitcoin sales to the Cash App in January 2018, and Square has also been funding bitcoin development for years.

That’s arguably more than Elon Musk has ever done for crypto, and yet Dorsey hasn’t shown anything close to Elon’s yen for philosopher-king mountaintop declarations. (And Square, for what it’s worth, is in the process of eating PayPal’s lunch.)

Price Trend consistent with all the cryto stocks. Earlier in the year (Jan through March specifically), when Bitcoin had a good day, all Bitcoin stocks were up huge during the day, for example, $riot $mara 30% a day; $can $ebon $sos up 50% a day.
Since late March to early May, Bitcoin had jumped from $30K to $64K peak, but all stocks mentioned would stay flat when Bitcoin had a good day and dropped big time when bitcoin had a flat or down day.
MUST have to do with big money shifting to DOW. Only small and cheap retail players still gambling here by the hour or minutes or days. When will the Big Money Rotate again ??? When inflation becomea a bigger and noticeable concern again is my guess!! Late May to July and it will likely to Happen and it will happen extremely fast !!

Does anyone know what time of day that RIOT will release earnings this coming Monday?
##############################
##############################
I don't think shorts were anticipating this kinda bullish action the trading day BEFORE earnings - they probably thought they could bleed us one more day and they'd take the day off on Monday when they'd know RIOT could jump hard. So now that the MM's have thrown a wrench in their plans, Monday could be quite interesting on positive earnings and more pressure to the upside.
##############################
##############################
What’s this manipulation? $CLSK down when $MARA and $RIOT is up. Should be the other way around considering they have the same future profit but $CLSK has way lower market cap.

Earnings on riot ...
First realize timing of such release.

Me as CEO...
Yes we sold 900 bitcoin at 62000 .. for obvious reasons..
Yes we have unlimited supply of miners .installing as fast as we receive them.
Current delivered x. Currently waiting y

Here come z...
We are preparing for level 1 on bitcoin.
We realize we missed fully the level of 4.
Bitcoin follows 4 levels for the fomos.

Yes china and India are creating harsh guidelines to acceptance of coins vs their fiat(s).

But being u.s. based with NO ETFs insite...
We will.cont to.mine until.our electric bill shows up..

Earnings out,

What a disaster, so much for my estimate of as much as 40 cents per share in earnings.

Later tonight will detail some of the line items that made is such a disaster.

Amazing how they control the writing and dialogue so someone not familiar with the companies antics might think this was somehow a good report.
##############################
##############################
no respect for people's time.... Let's get this over with already!
##############################
##############################
Giving up a good part of the earlier gains. Was up 19%, now up 12%. Hopefully it closes with a gain of 10% or more. But dropping pretty quickly.
##############################
##############################
Even though crypto currency will be around in the USA for awhile, China is going to ban it and therefore I am out. It may go up a bit because of hopeful people buying the dip, but then it will crash hard because of China. Good luck everyone.

WOW corruption.... was not "allowed"
Blocked all morning from buying 1 bitcoin at 30k through 35K ..
At 38K it magically opens ...
Wt holy corruption batman..

P
S..
I own this at 21. Will sit on it until it dies back to 21 or goes to 40.
Just saying.... seems the bottom ..
Line is gov or some bigger peeps outthere closed retail from buying bitcoin at such low numbers ...
For reasons beyond my double inflation. Background .. think "Volcker Saturday night"
Look it up .. if u dont know what that means..
##############################
##############################
Yes this is ugly, so people bought RIOT at $62 when bitcoin was $59,000. and everyone rushed in. Bitcoin struggled to stay so high. Now bitcoin is $36,000 - I am buying when it hits in the low point maybe $20 or $22.

I am listening only to make instincts, blocking the noise and robo posting & I will succeed. I always do!!!
##############################
##############################
bitcoin price will likely fall further this week, but then skyrocket next week because it's oversold. The same with riot. Hold on and don't sell the news, buy the dip. Shorts can't keep it down forever, and will be forced to buy if bitcoin prices double.
##############################
##############################
Ok let’s say you’re short Bitcoin. You just had a drop of 12k. Maybe you covered or maybe you didn’t. Bitcoin went back up to 40. Sorry Joe but when my cat died and we stuck her in the freezer because the ground was frozen to dig a hole. I took her out to bury her and the bag slipped and fell to the ground. Let’s just say it didn’t bounce to 40k. I think a bottom was put in. There is a lot of corrupt money in Bitcoin and they won’t lose it. Now I’m not saying 500k, but back up to 50k, is possible. If was short Bitcoin, I would be more worried than if I was long after today...at least for the near term.
##############################

MARA just posted their earnings report today. Increased by 1400%. So RIOT is probably gonna have the same if not better!!!! LETS GOOOOOOO

Bitcoin is down for the day as well as from its high of $63K April 13th - it will be back. Ignore the trolls - these were the guys that did not play sports growing up & did not go to the prom ( they are angry people).

Its been a tough road but has nothing to do with the various stocks all market & BTC related
##############################
##############################
I dodged a bullet not investing in this stock. Just started researching it. Now I have no clue what the future is for RIOT or anything in the crypto world. Best of luck to anyone in this segment. Hope you can recover.

Price target slashed over 50 %

This analyst is still off by about $25 as he still targets a $40 target,

he must be an advisor or have an investment baking relationship so he published terrible upbeat research.

However, while long-term bullish, due to the drop in Bitcoin’s price and the recent volatility, Dede thinks it is prudent to keep a lid on expectations on the anticipated BTC price in the near-term. Accordingly, Dede dropped his FY21 revenue and EPS estimates from $205.3 million and $1.95 to $166.6 million and $0.85, respectively.

To this end, Dede slashed his price target from $64 to $30, while reiterating a Buy rating on RIOT stock. (To watch Dede’s track record, click here)

Get out before Tesla does:

"Bitcoin's price was uncharacteristically steady in the last three weeks of March, averaging $55,100. So the math suggests that Tesla sold around 4,800 Bitcoins at that price to raise the $272 million. We also can reckon what Tesla originally paid for its stake. Since it pocketed a 59% gain on every Bitcoin sold, its original cost must have been about $34,700. Makes sense. That's close to the average quote in the January to early February period that bookends Tesla's purchases. It appears that the $1.5 billion investment bought roughly 43,000 Bitcoin.

Once again, the book value––or what it paid––for the tokens sold is $171 million. So we know the approximate balance-sheet number for what remains is the original investment of $1.5 billion, less the $171 million, or about $1.329 billion.

Result: Tesla still holds around 38,300 Bitcoin that cost $1.329 billion. At Bitcoin's price of $54,100 on April 26, Tesla's trove is worth over $2.07 billion. Tesla's gain on what it still owns is $741 million. Add the $101 million from the Q1 sale, and its total take is $842 million."

Start averaging in slowly. Find some comfort in knowing it isn’t just RIOT that is bleeding. Look at any miner and you will see the same down trend in equal intensity. Bitcoin has, so far, held above 43K during its down trend and has since recovered. I bought in the low 50s. I’m completely prepared to see what happens. If it continues to drop, so be it; I’ll average down (slowly) and when this decides to go on another bull run in the future- distant or near- I’ll be here.

Weekend update for all of my $BFARF, $DMGGF, $HUTMF, $HVBTF, $MARA, and $RIOT Buddies and Buddettes.

Tip of the hat to $BFARF for announcing approval for NASDAQ listing on the Global Markets tier.

Tip of the hat to all Canadian miners for closing in the GREEN, today.

Three issues for today.

First, last week I wrote about these miners all being on my team, and giving the ball (puck) to the player with the hot hand, as an investment strategy. I have posted over the past few weeks that $BFARF was close to listing (hot hand), so I hope others were able to pick up the gains.

Second, a word about volatility. Volatility begets trading and trading begets volatility. It says so in the Bible, I think, somewhere after “Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.”

Third, I keep having a dream about a 1,000 lb Gorilla, actually it’s just a very fat monkey. Nevertheless, I think this is a metaphor for the P/E multiple that will eventually be applied to NASDAQ miners posting profits in their quarterly/yearly reports. The current NASDAQ average multiple is 37.

For comparison, “Sandstorm Gold has a 12-month low of $5.96 and a 12-month high of $10.63. The firm has a market capitalization of $1.51 billion, a P/E ratio of 194.55… The company reported $0.03 earnings per share for the quarter…”

You can look up the business model, etc., but my point is that if they enjoy a 194.55 multiple, what should our miners expect? For a list of high P/E multiple stocks, you can search this site:

High PE Ratio Stocks 2021 | MarketBeat

Our three miners listed (about to list) on the NASDAQ should be highly profitable in Q1. At least I know $BFARF will be. Further, its approximate 1 EH/s hashrate for Q1 is already at 1.42 EH/s for Q2.

More importantly, guidance for $BFARF, $MARA, and $RIOT for 2022 is 8, 10.3, and 7.7, respectively. I know difficulty will be getting harder, but those are GREAT growth numbers. $MARA will get there in early 2022.

We all know the Canadian miners are undervalued, but I truly believe $MARA and $RIOT are, also, undervalued. That’s what the fat monkey told me - I know, but he could speak English….

I think we just need quarter after quarter of increasing profits to drive a much higher P/E multiple, that will, of course, accrue to other Canadian miners, when they list on the NASDAQ. How about 100-200? It’s mind boggling.

Remember, as capacities increase, so will the value of Bitcoin, at least, we think so.

Bitcoin is rising. Next week should be great for everyone!

Have a GREAT weekend and Good Luck!

Well, tomorrow should be interesting. I am not long yet. The next and last remaining Fibo correction level would be around 17, for a 78.6% correction of the entire runup from 1 to 80. Fibo numbers don't always work, but probably they are better than pure guesswork/gambling. However, because there are plenty of speculator/gamblers on this message board who will be trying to catch the bottom, I won't be all that anxious to buy right away.

I miss green. But keep in mind that this moves best with Bitcoin's momentum. As long as Bitcoin keeps ranging here, RIOT will bleed out slowly. When Bitcoin realizes that inflation is unstoppable and flies up to $60K, RIOT will move up 20-30%.

Total liability and stockholder equity is 375 million right now. They last reported 1717 bitcoin held I’m sure they mined more by now but based o. This number even if bitcoin went to 400k tomorrow this isn’t worth 1 billion market cap. That’s how crazy this got and it went all the way up to the 80’s. People really don’t know what they are buying

Who cares how much they mined, or that they will post an earnings on March ended quarter.

Next week once earnigns come out and insiders can sell, look for a real collapse

Before I thought $22 might be a short term bottom, but momentum so negative and so many insiders know they have a limitedd window before bitcoins are all mined or the practice is even outlawed for wasting engergy with no benefit to society.

It could even plunge through 22 support then find a short term range anywehere from $10 to $ 15.

Bought more puts today in anticipatipion of next week's colapse.

Can not wait to see the mining numbers for April which may get reported this week. RIOT should be operating at 1.5EH/s average for April and this will translate to 9.15 BTC/day given current global hash rates and difficuly. This tells me they generated 258 BTC at a minimum in April but could be higher to 274 under perfect conditions. Translates to approx. 258 X $57K/BTC = $14.7M Gross Revenue. The growth rate continues to grow stronger. I would say we are close to a breakout.

Don't get me wrong, still expecting this to go way lower over next 30 days.

Despite the commentary - BTC is down from its high today of $58.2K.

Riot is all about bitcoins highs and lows for the day - read back Joe MAX's commentary he has been spot on.

Look at the daily chart bitcoin has been trading down TODAY since its high of $58.2K at 6:30 AM. When BTC climbs back up this moves up ( we are in the down part of the day). Do your homework, no short cuts & stop complaining.

Anyone who does not get this deserves to lose money & sell at a loss.

A total of 697 Bitcoins were produced by the end of April compared with 389 Bitcoins a year ago, according to the cryptocurrency mining firm.

Riot also said that 6,500 S19 Pro Antminers were shipped in early May and are expected to be installed in Q2. The company expects to have a total of 22,946 Antminers in operation, utilizing approximately 73 megawatts with an estimated hash rate capacity of 2.3 exahash per second, upon full deployment of additional miners.

One perspective is that if bitcoin stays in the 50k to 60k range that would deter new companies from being created. It would give us time to become bigger and better. It would in warren buffet's own words, create a "moat" of high cost. We could protect ourselves from future competitors.

Lol at earnings release. They have 1,775 BTC @ $44,000 and falling. That is $78M of the $275M. So the current value after the draw down in share price is $2B. For the $2B you get $78M in coins and $200M in cash and future coin production at a completely unknown price. I'm all in!

Critical inflection point. What was Friday (Yesterday)? Was it the kickoff of a breakout bull leg higher? Or was it a fakeout move, meant to suck in those trying to catch the falling knife?????? I bought Friday when RIOT was up 16%. So near the top of Friday. However, I bought a little above 25 and the high was 80. If it was the start of a new major leg higher, then buying the one-day top was fine. Seems like the modest correction in the overall market is probably over. If so, bitcoin will probably have a monster leg up to, what, 100K? And RIOT to $100 or a little above?

Retail shake out. Buying ratio is higher than selling. Order flow shows retail investors bought this stock quite a bit. This will continue to go down but I won’t be selling a single share for a loss.

Unfortunately, Riot is doing all their mining in Coinmint LLC.'s facility in Massena, New York. This state is a democrat stronghold, so the potential passage of SB6486 by Democrat senator Kevin S. Parker should alarm every invested shareholder of Riot. If the bill is passed, crypto mining in New York would be banned for years to "reduce its environmental impact." Blue voters brought this on themselves, but there's no reason why shareholders should suffer. From where I sit, $MARA is a far safer place to keep your BTC mining money or go one better and get an early start investing in the massively undervalued, renewable powered, largest bitcoin miner in North America BitFarms $BFARF. If this bill miraculously doesn't get passed, you lost nothing by transitioning into an equivalent company in the same space. With $MARA doing great and $BFARF about to uplist, this could be a blessing in disguise.

Neutral here on riot and mara..
Sure a bit high time might have this move up.. only to crash dollars vs cents for every 1000 bitcoin down turn..
And only 20 to cents on the upswing..

Deflationary investment nothing good come forth from that..

Thank you Sean. Scott, Frank..and if missing anyone besides (pickleeggs lol)
Anyways, moving on.. rotation... RIOT was gooooooooooooood to me, when it performed with bitcoin.. at 10cents per 100 bitcoin either way bitcion went up.or down.. But after last 7 trading sessions...it has become uncomfortable for being greedily MM to point.. that 1000 up riot and mara move 50cents when bit goes 1000 downward .. they move 1dollar or.more..
Only way to even play this is with bit high of day.. if highs are in trading AM thru 8pm .. and still. (Seems only a weekend carryover) keeps MM at bay..
Made of 56 percent in last 30 days on A stock that went from 57 to 36 to 44.to 39.. yep .... I am out.. (still on watch list)
But .. "Papa's got a new bag"
Look into lumber (saw mills)
For next quarter.. look into other coins..
Other ways to play bitcoin.. ethereum or even crazy doge..
Watch jmia... look at upstart (crazy moves)
Forget played out stocks.. Nio.. tsla..
Etc.
Finding sectors.. in 2012 2016 times where tough. (Scty ) lololol. Appl.didnt move than either .

What I find fascinating is just a few months ago Musk says that Tesla is going to accept Bitcoin...it jumps. Then all of a sudden, a guy who literally knows all the ins and outs of energy and building his empire on it, comes to the realization that Bitcoin mining is an energy sucking machine. Though RIOT uses more renewable energy than most. Amazing the influence that one person has over our/your money.

TaX selloff combined with inflation..
Welcome to 1999 April 2000
##############################
##############################
Found out this company existed and was going to buy puts since it seems hilariously overvalued. Really surprised to see so many positive thoughts on this board.
##############################
##############################
imagine in 3 weeks riot can hit 60. realistically I dont see riot staying this low
##############################
##############################
shorts are in control. Help them by selling or help yourself by buying the dip. Its just a natter of time before this turns itself around towards 60.
##############################
##############################
Really surprised it has not tanked more with BTC touching 47,5k this morning...

Must say the fact it's up today is very impressive. I feel with any jump in BTC price this thing will skyrocket. Very dangerous stock to short, very resilient. I know a lot of people use it to daytrade given it's awesome intraday volatility, but I have the feeling that more and more institutional investors will go long in RIOT since it is a good exposure to crypto, it's one of the "big" ones and it is a north american company.

35$ looked like a bargain in that context, added to my position.
##############################
##############################
Stay strong, It hard to see the falling figures. Hold on hard. We will rise again together . They can bend but never break us. It’s hard but we will be okay. We need calm and patience. Take care guys
##############################
##############################
William - Wrong. Options predict 27 to 30 out for the next month
##############################
##############################
Riot will be fine. Blackrock has 1.3 million shares. Vanguard 2.7 million shares. Riot already hit 80 and that was with the current 25k miners. 40k miners are projected for October. $100+ end of year coming.
##############################
##############################
Bitcoin at 59k. Look for a green week if @BTC remain or rise from here. Shorts better cover.
##############################
##############################
How much y’all think this is closing at tomorrow?
##############################
##############################
last place i need it to visit, riot get ready for the countdown tomorrow
##############################

If you can’t handle reds you don’t deserve greens!!!

Do y’all think history can repeat itself?

Heads up on history, during the 07 to 10 financial crisis, there are a lot of repeat history going on here, if you go back and trend market sectors and such.

Right now everyone knows the logistics situation is no bueno! Back then ocean shipping stocks went through the roof because of lack of ships. Freight rates where all time highs. Well guess what those ocean freight stocks are up 400% with 65% owned by institutions. Most of them have less than 150 million shares of float. Check the BDI and FBX shipping rates. Most rates are over 600% and will continue for 18 to 36 months until all the backlog and logistics are worked out with the world.

Trend these shipping stocks back to the financial crisis and apply to today’s scenario but x5 worse than back then.

The big boys are cornering this market. Look at institutional ownership in the stats column.

Peace out!
##############################
##############################
Dude when you get your GED get back to me.

BTC is down. Its not at $58K. Riot does well in a rising BTC environment- down BTC not so well.

Did I some how convinced you to buy this stock? Read back your own comments for the last few days you are def bi polar.

Let's face it no one makes decisions based on yahoo discussions this a board to share, vent & have an intelligent discussion.

here is the truth about the earnings date -- i said the nasdaq says monday the 10th others say the 17th from schwab and others -- the truth is no on knows for sure -- riot has not announced the date -- it the date is not announced nasdaq and the others look at when they have released in the past and they make an educated guess as to the date --- again riot has not formally announced the date

Fiat currency has value because of the tax base of the Govt issuing the currency.

Should I be surprised that Twitter is not blocking any of Musk's tweets that are causing major market disruptions? Are he and his friends now loading up on bitcoin at these discount prices? FCC should caution him on his wild comments. North American mining is largely considered clean energy. Chinese miners are the major polution producers and China is beginning to crack down on them. In 2020, Chinese companies were estimated to control 70% of the miners in operation but NA is in quick catch up mode and could well surpass China in 2022 with clean energy mining.

THIS WHOLE THING is IMO a scheme to get ownership out of the hands of the many and into the hands of a few. The action seems to have CABAL written all over it. Think I'm 🥜? Mkay. Lets circle back when they all 20% lower and talk about it some more! $MARA $RIOT $SOS

The people that own the mining companies are obviously bullish on crypto. So if we buy shares with dollars and the dollar is being inf lay Ted by the second and more and more people go crypto. Then what does this means for money we used to buy our shares? Asking for a friend please

TO: RIOT C.E.O paperhands... McGee..
Did u not hear that Fresh BIT mints are better than the rest.. i would strongly suggest.. and have strongly suggested..
That you use words "Virgin coins" clean coins... and TWIST back with "blame electric company for their fossil fuel use.
Until than people.. Keep driving that gas car.. . And when u buy EV.. ask yourself ... if my solar panel will charge it???
NOPE.. so therefore... the future mining of BIT.. is relatively same as you peeps driving an EV for 250 miles a full charge as riot mining 1 coin...
Until than blame electric power supply NOT the people that use it!!!!!.

i love riot. i have 22k in it. just im getting way better gains on other crypto stocks. ( gbtc ethe and eth coin.)

gbtc up 8% riot should not be up 5 percent. bc if btc was down today well be down 12%
##############################
##############################
Let’s hope it goes back up to 58k

##############################
Despite everything (Btc, Nasdaq). RIOT has been resilient. This drop shall pass... better days ahead. 💪🏼
##############################
##############################
1 month down 66 % ouch. ..
##############################
##############################
Like I said earlier, bloodbath phase in BTC in progress, RIOT already discounted some of this, but I would expect a drop to sub 20 as BTC continues to deteriorate. GBTC going to get hammered..
##############################
##############################
Don’t let the dip scare you. Riot will come back up they have earnings on the 15th it will be back up to 67 bucks￼￼. Or mote I’m 500 shares in.

Isaac - You are trading with a high probability of success. But to naked short those puts you must have a boatload of money. I imagine you are shorting in size. May I ask how many naked short puts you have on in RIOT. I understand if you don't wish to answer.

Big question: Is today the bottom or are we going to see more red tomorrow?
##############################
##############################
Whinstone purchased for 650 mil. Depreciating assets that needs to get upgraded as more bitcoin blocks are mined it will take more electricity and more hardware upgrades over time. Owns 1771 bitcoin. Let’s be nice 100 million plus 650 million. You got like 750 million. Let’s say riot adds 1700 more bitcoin by end of year and bitcoin hits 100k. 347 mil plus 650 mil = 997 mil. Current market cap doesn’t make sense and I went crazy on projections. This cut in half is even pure speculation
##############################
##############################
Well the good news were 11% higher right now than we were in premarket
##############################
##############################
Big picture. I think Riot is more than a miner and they are just setting the table for a major play.

Corporate currencies looking for legitimacy will be backed by crypto. Google/Apple pay brought to you by the full faith and backing of Riot.

Sorry about the price action lately. It stinks but much the way Amazon started by selling books, riot started by mining.

Nice Wednesday right..
and shamed on friday (riot vs chart of bitcoin) yep..
My "fishing freinds" ... are laughing hard
Called highs on time of bit since
January here. Understand how... and also how .. the offspring mining (stocks)
Riot and mara are massively being MM to a s.e.c. level ... charts clearly demonstrate such in-house market manipulations... One suggests m cap.control understood.. however.. the legal factor.. of course is when one MM demonstrates a particular reason to do such.. (example) ... help shorts. Or moreover deeper... if a stock follows an indicator. I.e. bitcoin here... than charts will equate to equality to such, and only be MM to control market caps. (Control s for bubble). Otherwise ... sectors can not grow, in form with index indicators
Bitcoin.....
Saying this in this forum.. no one here will understand..
So here is something u all will
GO RIOT rockets rockets rockets.

Now that we have the ‘Elon factor’ all I want to know is how low does he want it to go before he starts loading again? Lol
(By the he actually Tweets positive stuff again it will be too late, he will then be selling in to the strength just like he did after he sent out the tweet TSLA was accepting Bitcoin....) he buys in bulk so he needs lots of sheep to buy what he is selling... so now it would appear he is looking for a good dump to get back in on the lows so watch for large sweeps coming through when it gets low enough Lol

This is a lesson for all. I should have learned this long ago, but I am a gambler and always pull the trigger too soon. Probably this stock will not be liquidated at $0 - I think the bitcoin story is real and will continue and RIOT will likely be part of that. But too many people are buying on the way down at this time. I messed up also, even though I know better. I bought at $26, way, way too early. 22.5, price right now, is also way too early. Everyone loses nearly all their money on such a crash. No matter where you buy on the way down, you lose nearly all your money. What is the difference between losing 80% and 95%. Nothing. You are wiped out in either case.

Simply put, this is a second-chance stock. BITF has intentionally kept itself under wraps and out of the mainstream investing radar.. until now. It's especially impressive compared to it's soon to be peers on NASDAQ and whether it grows to match or to exceed $MARA & $RIOT, there's no denying that we're looking at a company worth what these were valued at a year or two ago while also outperforming them in multitudes of ways. It's on sale, so let's not let this "second-chance" go un-taken.

I think Wall St. has it out for crypto as they view it as serious competition and potentially an existential threat. The easiest way for them to attack it is to CRUSH miners and its working they are getting obliterated. SOS was an easy mark so it started here but now it's all of them. If Wall St. wants em all down 50% then that's coming. Hope I don't sound too paranoid but look at all the market cap destruction in this industry and nothing else makes sense.
If I was a private equity BiGSHoT I would be eyeballing these right now. All of 'em.

I expect RIOT will see 10%+ gains per day coming again soon especially if this chart continues to prove accurate...
https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pantera-stock-flow.png?format=webp
I like this chart from Pantera which shows a BTC price projection for the 15th of each month and how many weeks ahead or weeks behind before that price was met. Every projected price has been met even if it happened weeks faster or weeks slower than projected. Next projection shows BTC at $74,474 on May 15, 2021.

Worst Business Model Ever

Remember as you are makgin your investment decisions.

Only 2.3 million bitcoins left to be mined, every miner and Rusia China all having to split the limited avialability.

All bitocin expected to be mined by 2030, so effectivley in 7 years, RIOT has no business model.

In meantime insiders need to fleece as much cpaital from unsespecting investors as possible so they can keep salaries in place and have soem cushion when they are forced to pivot to a new business.

As the Bitcoins become more scare every single month and harder to mine ( by defintion of how prograsm were written ), expect they will put a big spin on their business plan.

Who feels lucky enoguh to invest in a company guranteed to not have a future, unless they can magic up a new buiness.

According to a fellow bitfarm investor:
Bitfarms is the first publicly traded Bitcoin miner to announce it will be trading on The Nasdaq Global Market®️ tier. This tier is reserved for companies who fulfill financial liquidity and requirements above and beyond what it takes to list on The Nasdaq Capital Market®️, the lower tier upon which other Bitcoin miners trade. This represents a powerful validation of our global focus that has been at the core of Bitfarms since its founding in 2017.❤️❤️🚀🚀

nas up means riot will go nuts.

next week if stocks recover riot will follow
##############################
##############################
April 14, Bitcoin at 4:00PM stock market close $62,145
April 15, Bitcoin at 4:00PM stock market close $63,476
That's UP roughly 2%.

April 14, RIOT at 4:00 PM stock market close $48.11
April 15, RIOT at 4:00 PM stock market close $50.16
That's DOWN roughly 4%.

The pattern will continue. RIOT is no longer tracking Bitcoin as it once did. The dilution of shares has been so significant that there is no recovery; The stock will wither until it's down around $20; and if bitcoin doesn't spike up in a big way (as in a BIG way, like to $100,000 by year's end), RIOT will shrivel to below $10. Rest assured, RIOT is going down from where it is today; it will no doubt be an up two notches down three notches type of bumpy slide down the hill, but it will go down the hill.

The only scenario that RIOT is higher than $50 at year's end is if we have $200,000 bitcoins. That's possible, yet not all that likely. And if you truly believe there will be $200,000 bitcoin by year's end, why are you messing with RIOT stock? Just go get some bitcoin, and triple your money.

Riot acquiring Whinstone will be monumental in Riot reaching new highs. Incredible for those holding and buying that they're backed by the biggest in Blackrock, and also Vanguard.

“Riot views Whinstone as a foundational element in its strategy to become an industry-leading Bitcoin mining platform, on a global scale,” per the release. “Upon the closing of this acquisition, Riot is expected to be the largest publicly-traded Bitcoin mining and hosting company in North America, as measured by total developed capacity.”

Guys, please. Stop spreading unsubstantiated views about the valuation. Some claim that the shares are worth one dollar, others that a thousand. You'd better do some research and see how experts value stocks. Dede valued Riot's shares at $ 64 and Mara's shares at $ 50, macroaxis analyzes rate the company slightly more pessimistic than Dede, but not tragically. The shares are now obviously at least at a fair price, not counting all the machines that arrive every day and potential future profits.

What people fail to see here is Ethereum is close to all time high while BTC has been trailing big time in the last 2 weeks.

Last time like that was in Jan-Feb, and we all know what happened. BTC rallied from mid 30k to 53k.

This is no real correction, if it really was Ethereum would have tanked. BTC will bounce, and then it will be a tough period for shorts...

##############################
What really gets me about BitFarms is that it may arguably have superior operations than $RIOT or $MARA while also being considerably less diluted than $HVBTF and closer to uplisting than $HUTMF but is still relatively unknown. After listening to the previous conference call and reading the latest press releases, I became convinced it's the best deal in mining by far (even outshining $INTV and $MGTI since $BFARF tends to rise even on BTC's down days) 👌
##############################
##############################
This stock was below $1 just a year ago and now people think it’s undervalued at $30?? Get some perspective, it should never have gotten this high in the first place... just because it got to $80 in feb doesn’t make this price level a deal...

TARGETING 29.28 TO ADD MORE RIOT. down 5 days in a row , very very oversold on indicators.

##############################
##############################
There are too many hopeful and wildly bullish people on this message board for it to be time to buy. I thought maybe the 30 level, a 61.8% fibo retracement level, might be the bottom. Does not appear to be. Next and final fibo level is the 78.6% retracement, which would occur at a RIOT stock price around 17. Earnings report is next Monday and I think it will be very bullish. Could RIOT stock crash to $17 by Monday?
##############################

Reading between the lines....

So, the company is "finalizing" its Form 40-F? Let's look at that form, again. From my source:

"...Form 40-F, which is essentially a wrap of its Annual Information Form (AIF), audited financials and management discussion and analysis (MD&A)..."

They already "finalized" their Annual Information Form (AIF). In fact, they updated it on April 7th well into the NASDAQ process. Their financials are audited by Price Waterhouse - top tier (I see no need for change there. Their MD&A was posted on March 25th, once again, well into the NASDAQ process, so we can assume it was fair, accurate, and acceptable.

So, what does "finalizing" mean? I think they are and have been ready to go, but are awaiting more favorable market conditions. From April 5th to last Friday's close, $MARA, a GREAT miner, went down 32%. I wouldn't call that period "favorable market conditions."

From my perspective, they wait for Bitcoin to begin a healthy and sustained up-tick, send in their 40-F, get approved and announce a date for listing. If Bitcoin makes its move to $70,000+, it will be the perfect storm. BTW, Bitcoin dove deep today and is coming back up. That pattern usually precedes an ATH. So, it could get quite interesting, this week.

If I were mgmt, I would wait until $MARA and $RIOT go back up. Those two great miners are who $BFARF will be compared to, for valuation. Wouldn't you wait?

Just my 2 cents - Good luck.
##############################
##############################
I bought 10 shares at 40. Did this about a month ago and sold at 60-65 i cant remember before it dropped back under 40 again. So hoping it'll run the same process it's been doing all month where bitcoin will go up and riot will get up to the 60-70s again. Sell wait for it to drop and buy more, rinse and repeat. anybody else doing this? lol
##############################
##############################
all stocks been down. not riot. just hope riot will recover like the other stocks would recover

Man still buying that downtrend. Can't believe I got more at 25$ in the premarket.

When that growth/tech inflation FUD is going to go away and BTC bounces to the 70-75k, watch that thing fly.

Not a stock for the faint of heart, for sure!

company. Have a great weekend 📈

"Riot at 79 when Bitcoin at 57k? Now Bitcoin at 63, riot at 48? Makes no sense....."
It makes sense if you realize Citron (sic) and Andrew Left are now in the picture. I held INOVIO from the high 30 range until the current price of 9.01. At that point, enter Citron and proceeded to bludgeon (arguably the best biotech stock in the industry, see current news on tremendous vaccine news) the price unmercifully. Mr. Left reported on CNBC that he and his family received threats to their well-being (you think?) The short selling machine will chew up any stock, good or bad (witness Gamestop) which was only saved by the efforts of WallStreetBets (of which I am a member). I have held a significant long position in RIOT since I bought it at 6. Today I sold because there is little defense against organizations such as CITRON and HINDENBURG. Good luck to all.....

“Riot Blockchain mined 491 Bitcoins in the first quarter, with 187 of those coming in March alone. This was a notable increase from last year. First-quarter Bitcoin production was up 75% from the same period in 2020, and production in March was up 80% year over year.”

Weekend update for my $DMGGF, $BFARF, $HUTMF, $HVBTF, $MARA, and $RIOT Buddies and Buddettes.

Last week, I asked if it could get any worse. No more questions.

Tip of the Hat this week to $HUTMF for being the only Miner in the Green on Tuesday.

Tip of the Hat to $DMGGF for being up 25% on Wednesday.

Tip of the Hat to $BFARF, $MARA, and $RIOT for being up at the close today.

Two weeks ago, I sold off most of my diversified portfolio to concentrate on mining. Not my best strategy of the year.

This past week, I thought the lows were so enticing, I opened a small business to earn some money for more mining shares. I bought a bunch of Wild Animal hats for my dog and stuck a sign in the yard saying, “PETTING ZOO - $0.50” – big mistake…

Undaunted, I did what any investor would do, I transferred money from the bank to my brokerage account. HOKEY SMOKES! The wife was furious – she likes sales, so I am not sure what's up with that.

I decided it was time for a little man ‘splainin’. I said I am an investor and investors need money to invest.

She informed me we are now a married couple without privileges. What’s up with that, Buddettes?

The most telling movement of the week was $DMGGF’s 25% gain on Wednesday (I added a little, today). I think that shows the miners are all at the bottom – stretched like rubber bands, ready to snap back up!

Hopefully, Bitcoin will trade sideways over the weekend to round out the bottom of a new teapot that is forming. Maybe by midweek, we can begin the long-awaited next leg up, with some conviction.

Have a great weekend and Good Luck!
