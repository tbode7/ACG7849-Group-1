May 25 today. Today is the day by which the Mesabi/Essar default on the Minnesota leasehold must be cured. Mesbi said last week that it had met all the "critical" leasehold terms. But we all know that it is just baloney. None of the major terms of the lease have been met. But we will see shortly what will go down. Minnesota and its DNR will have to put out a statement as to whether the default has been cured. If there is no default any more (ie it has been cured), then Mesabi keeps the leases and we should see public statements to that effect on all sides. If the default still exists, Minnesota can come put out a press release that the lease is officially terminated or one that states that they are renegotiating with Mesabi for a lease extension with new or adjusted terms. This is going to be interesting. If the lease is terminated, expect Mesabi to put out a press release immediately stating that they are suing the state for wrongful termination of the lease. Furthermore, Mesabi may also declare bankruptcy a second time and attempt to tie the leases up in the courts, like they successfully did several years ago. This would allow Mesabi to keep the leases and Essar would figure out how to maintain ownership. Essar holds $260 million in Mesabi bonds. Mesabi defaults on the bonds and bankruptcy is declared. Essar the pulls Mesabi out of bankruptcy by converting a tiny portion of the bonds into equity and renegotiates the terms on the remaining bonds. Essar then tells the bankruptcy court judge that their "offer" in bankruptcy is for like $250 million. No outsider would be able to buy Mesabi from the bankruptcy court in such a scenario. No outside would ever pay $250 million to Essar for the defaulted Mesabi bonds. To achieve this, Essar again would have to find a straw man and set up another set of offshore shell companies with hidden ownership, like they did with the #$%$ Tom Clarke in the last bankruptcy.

I made some pickup purchases at our local building supplies store this evening. A couple interesting notables. They are hiring, advertising check out clerks full time with benefits are getting $16.50/hr plus a nice array of benefits. Also they offer get a $500 bonus if they hire on and stay past July 1. More is paid for yard workers etc.

I had to pay about $9 to buy a 1by2 by 10’ pine strip. Price premiums are across the board.

That has me thinking that we are still on the front end of a game changing run for materials production of materials using Cliffs steel products. $1600 + HRC pricing for June is remarkable.

Assuming at end of 2022, all long term debt, preferred stock and all pension liability totaled $4B (after massive pay down of all 3 components in 2021 and 2022), then potential for refinancing the whole "ball of wax" with term loan --
7 years at 7%???----annual payments on debt service approximately $725M
Add maintenance capital expenditures $1B+/-
In 2023 and beyond, any free cash flow over and above let's say $1.75B can be used for stock buybacks, dividends etc.
The above is just guesstimate---Also, LG could deal with approximate $3B pension liability separately at much lower payback rate if he chose to do so.
I defer to Pumperduck et.al. on the above---presented for discussion purposes only.
Parenthetically does anyone know how many common shares are outstanding at this time?---still does not seem 100% clear---

In honor of Mr. Bob Dylan - a native-born HibTac neighbor...

North Country Blues:

Come gather 'round friends and I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran a-plenty
But the cardboard-filled windows and old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty
In the north end of town my own children are grown
But I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth my mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother
The iron ore poured as the years passed the door
The drag lines an' the shovels they was a-humming
'Till one day my brother failed to come home
The same as my father before him
Well, a long winter's wait from the window I watched
My friends they couldn't have been kinder
And my schooling was cut as I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner
Oh, the years passed again, and the giving was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born, the work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason
Then the shaft was soon shut, and more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'Till a man come to speak, and he said in one week
That number eleven was closing
They complained in the East, they are paying too high
They say that your ore ain't worth digging
That it's much cheaper down in the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothing
So the mining gates locked, and the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Where the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking
I lived by the window as he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was building
'Till one morning's wake, the bed it was bare
And I was left alone with three children
The summer is gone, the ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're all folding
My children will go as soon as they grow
Well, there ain't nothing here now to hold them.

^This is why I invest in CLF. LG sees the value of this land and it's people when the world has been trying to forget them since 1963.

As an aside, I can't wait to be seeing ore boats this weekend!

Cyclicals like steel tend to spike real hard after a solid run up. CLF’s spikes in the last takes about 3-6 months. When it’s popping that hard, I’m finding an exit.

$60 is coming eventually, but a spike will make this unreasonably high. I’ll be watching the chart pretty closely.
It could rise much higher than $60 in this kind of scenario. I believe it’s going to do just that.

5-23-21 7:30 AM EST

The following is part of a direct quote from LG dated 5-10-21.

"Steel demand should reflect any improvement in legislation towards supporting infrastructure," he said. "It will be an immediate impact because as soon as we see the indications and the commitments for infrastructure, we will start investing and preparing for the demand."

Pay particular attention to: “we will START investing and PREPARING for the demand."

Per LG' words ….. that DOES NOT MEAN that an infrastructure bill will have any IMMEDIATE impact on demand. It means with the passage of a meaningful infrastructure bill LG will START investing and PREPARING for anticipated increased demand.

If anyone thinks that the purchase of someone else's active facilities would increase overall steel supply they're “barking up the wrong tree.”

Those that currently own those facilities know the situation as well as LG and IMO would be very reluctant to part with them unless he showered them with bushels of money.

So ask yourself, #1. Where would LG invest? #2. How would he prepare? #3. How long would it take for those investments and preparations increase CLF's steel output?

Seems to me the quickest and least expensive route would be to fire-up some of CLF's now idle facilities.

Thoughts and comments???

" Another interesting pick on Reddit forums in the undervalued list is steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE: CLF), one of the largest steel manufacturers in the United States that has a lot to gain from recent government plans to pour hundreds of billions into American infrastructure.

Something we haven’t talked much about with CLF and an infrastructure play is electrical steel. The former AKS remains the only domestic producer of electrical steel and it’s innovation and quality have been world class.

Unabated dumping of electrical steel over the last decade by countries such as Japan have minimized former AKS production. Also, the Butler Works is a terrible place logistically speaking to make any type of steel.

Nevertheless, GOES & NOES will be required for the grid and EV’s. So my question is how can CLF electrical steel capacity play in a US infrastructure/environment where electrical steel will be in high demand?

So again, stay tuned. That's going to come out again in the next few months where we're going to highlight and make some very strong commitments to what we think is already best-in-class to become even better.”

It is a bit humorous to me to read all these chat board posts about the price manipulation of CLF shares, especially in the short term price action. I am a long term holder and could care less what CLF shares do intraday or from day to day in the short term. I own shares from $6.50 to below $2. I am not selling and have held for several years. The funny thing it that all the complaining about short term price manipulation is being done by what appear to me be be short term day traders in CLF shares. Well, who do these people think that the price manipulation is targeted at. It isn't targeted at me as I don't fall for this baloney. The manipulation is designed to extract fast money from super short term investors and day traders. They are the suckers getting fleeced. So if you are a short term trader in CLF, you are being set up to be fleeced. Sure, every so ofter a day trader here gets it right and crows about their "success", but these types of traders are greatly outnumbered by the losers and the one time successful trader in a CLF trade also then goes on to lose the profits in other day trades that are not successful. These people are on the wrong end of a loser's game. So, they come here to complain.

But salvation is at hand. I have the answer to all your problems in this regard. Stop day trading CLF and take a long term perspective. Change your profit motive from highly taxed short term gains towards low taxed long term capital appreciation. If you cease day trading, you provide no opportunity for the manipulators to profit off your bad short term trading moves. These operators are called manipulators, not because they are manipulating the stock price, but because they are manipulating you. Wait for CLF to hit a downdraft and buy for the long term. You will actually find that you will also make better money in the short term as you are prepared to hold for the long term and will not make idiotic short term trading decisions to the benefit of the manipulators.

With NUE staying near yearly highs, steel prices starting to rise again, the last couple of days and analysts upgrading and rasing targets for CLF, and soon to be raising CLF guidance again in a few weeks, after the deal MT sale, CLF flys to new yearly high.

What a difference a year makes. This was NUE CEO last year about this time. during a Q&A with Argus. Do you think there is a future where EAF minimills will produce all the steel for the automotive industry, or will there remain a role for integrated mills??Do I think eventually the EAFs will produce all the automotive needs? Yes. That is not going to be tomorrow or next year, but probably this decade.As we began to start up, the attitude was "let Nucor have the rebar and all the #$%$ stuff we do not want to produce." Today the only thing the integrateds produce is a little bit of plate and sheet, and that is it. There is nothing else they produce. They got away from all their beams, bar, joists ? everything now outside of sheet and plate is produced by EAFs.We are going to continue to grow market share. If the integrateds cannot produce at the cost levels of the minimill, it is the slippery slope that never stops. Our position as a low-cost producer, we cannot lose focus on that and we are not going to because that is the ultimate differentiator.?

Picked up another 1300. 35K now and looking at Fed holding above 2% more like 3 or 4% inflation with a lower yield curve for a good while. Best not to be in Equities after Q3. Maybe sooner. Money flow into the smaller consumers hands will along with fiscal driven policy throught hte end of the year including some type of infrastructure will push inflation. We see it! I don't care what they say.. As long as the Fed keeps buying bonds and printing money to give to the lower echelon, (you and me) then the yield will rise. When it's over and the money flows start buying goods and services it will invert and inflation will rear it's ugliness. if this happens where does the money flow for some since of value adding? Cash with inflation is loss of purchacing power. Nope! Don't be in cash. Treasury? Nope, it will yield less with a low yield vs inflation. Same boat as cash.. NO good. You still lose money. Some equities? maybe OK, but selective for sure. Gold and precious metals, yes, Bullish. Commodities? Yes, bullish! Value plays and hard tangible assets. The money will flow.
If the Fed is thinking that all this cash will just sit on the sideline, while rates are held above 3 or 4 %. They are stupid. No one will want to lose purchase power. Some may hedge in foreign equities. Good play, have some myself, but it want all go there. When people realize the FCF being generated and realize the future is a sustained period of inflation with lowering yield curve. They will flock to value and gold. I have spoken!

Infrastructure bill will bring immediate demand boost

Any meaningful infrastructure bill that is passed by Congress and the Biden administration will have swift and beneficial implications for the US steel industry, Goncalves said.
"Steel demand should reflect any improvement in legislation towards supporting infrastructure," he said. "It will be an immediate impact because as soon as we see the indications and the commitments for infrastructure, we will start investing and preparing for the demand."
##############################

So to summarize for the Democrat investors of CNBC. The EAF mills are not low cost producers of steel, they aren’t environmentally friendly and they aren’t safe for workers.

Futures market has turned and is rising again. There is a reason that BofA has gone Bullish jn TN e steel sector and with CLF particularly. Its fundamentals. The froth in the futures market has subsided. I believe its finally gone. I'm not saying that steel isn't still a bit inflated, but the unreasonable rise in the futures market due to emotional buying is gone.

Now its just fundamentals. Supply and demand. Case in point, futures is up clear through March of next year. With the exception of just October, which is down a measly $4, its clear that the market is accepting a new normal and for a much longer time. Its not going back to $468 any time soon. Nor $600, nor $750. Those days are long gone and I would imagine, never to be seen again. Inflation won't let it.

My other standing thesis for price support comes from China. Its a slow long slog for China to roll their steel industry over to EAF's. But, its happening, and in a massive way. China doesn't do small. And when I say slow, I mean slow for China and for us investors. We want it now. But, China is closing BOF's and replacing them with EAF. Why is that important? One word....Scrap. How does that help CLF? Its the Macro. China wants cleaner air, but China wants to grow even more. They are at an inflection point that they are readily admitting. They would prefer to go EAF all the time with minimal BOF but the scrap universe has to be able to support that. It can't. Not yet, and not with a 6% growth rate from China and India on their heels. Scrap is much more expensive than pellets. DRI, HBI or PIG iron is needed as well.

Currently Australia and Brazil are providing the lions share of fines feedstock. Thats important. Fines is Not clean feed. It can be, but overall its not. As China converts to EAF, it will create a measure of weakness in the IO market, but create support in the scrap market. It won't be devastating for the IO market, but it won't be the top dog. This in turn adds strong value in EAF and pellet producing companies. It will create support in the world pellet market with the APP for pellets. How does this affect CLF?

I thought you would never ask. CLF is going head to head with the best run steel company, IMO, in the world in NUE. They have tons of cash, produce a solid dividend, and just never miss a beat. Yet, NUE uses scrap.
....NUE uses....scrap. What happens as China stretches its massive Bear paw into the scrap market? Scrap goes up. NUE's feedstock.....Goes Up.

CLF, a fully integrated feedstock company that is 4 BOF and 4 EAF along with HBI will out muscle NUE hands down. The day of NUE providing a lower COGS on steel is over. Its over and its already happened. It may get close in the sparring world between NUE COGS and CLF COGS, but year in and year out....Its Over. CLF wins the COGS battle.

This is why I believe we should be fairly valued to NUE and not X. Not het, mind you. We still need to prove it with a balance sheet over the next 3 quarters. But, this stock is fundamentally changed in the dynamics of the Macro Steel environment. It will take less than 1 year for everyone to figure out, and its going to be a train ride for years to come.

So what is the angle of Mesabi/Essar now?

1. Essar is in deep deep financial trouble. They have no money. Their financial backers have recently collapsed in a dramatic and sudden wipeout. Their global steel enterprise is bankrupt. In such a case, Essar (which has no money) needs to have "assets" on the books. Assets can be used as collateral to delay and forestall a bank-driven foreclosure and provide value for the opportunity for a restructuring plan. Mesabi mineral leaseholds is without question an important "asset" to Essar, but I would argue that at this point it is probably worthless in reality as the lease will be pulled. Who knows at what value Essar/Mesabi valued these mineral rights on their balance sheets? And this is a key question!!!! If the Mesabi/Essar mineral rights are valued at $200 - $500 million equity on Essar's balance sheet, writing these assets down to zero would be a catastrophe. Furthermore, people should remember that Essar also "purchased" $260 million of Mesabi bonds last year. These "bonds" were a remnant of the original bankruptcy. I would bet my bottom dollar that Essar values these bonds on its balance sheet at par (a full $260 million). I have commented about this sham bond transaction previously, but there is an important point here. Essar has not only hidden equity ownership in Mesasbi (probably to the tune of 100%), it also has the $260 million of Mesabi bonds on its balance sheet. Who knows what value Essar has put on its Mesabi equity ownership, but I bet you that it is a big number and Essar used it to take out bank loans in Europe, India, and Australia. A writeoff of Mesabi value would mean that Essar has to write down both the bonds and equity in the project. This is something that Essar can not afford to do in regards to its global business.

2. Under no circumstances can the Mesabi card be pulled out from the Essar house of cards. Essar would collapse globally to the point of no return. With this in mind, Essar/Mesabi will fight to the death to keep the Mesabi leases and thus keep the fake values on its balance sheet, regardless of whether the project ever gets restarted.

3. Essar is in the impossible situation where it can not afford (does not have the money) to restart the Mesabi project, but it also can not afford to walk away from the project either as that would be the final nail in the coffin for Essar globally.

4. In addition, Essar's stature in the global marketplace and financial circles os so badly compromised, that no one will ever give them money.

What are the outcomes:

A. Minnesota pulls the leases and Essar files lawsuits. Essar will lose the lawsuit, but is able to keep their global house of cards afloat a bit longer until the case is resolved and after many appeals.

B. Essar gets yet another lease extension and the charade continues for another six months, when we will just be back to the same situation where we are now. In the meantime, Essar continues to maintain on its balance sheet the fake values it carries for the Mesabi project and represents to its global bankers (who know nothing about Minesota) that these are important undervalued assets. This keeps the bankers off of Essar's back for a bit.

C. A miracle happens and Essar is able to find some kind of idiot partner willing to go in with them on Mesabi. I would say that the odds of this are the brothers slim and none.

D. Measbi decides to throw in the towel, but attempts to "sell" its mineral rights and plant to a third party for some amount. Essar owns $260 million of Mesabi bonds and also has $100 million in equity escrow for Mesabi (but be advised that Essar may have borrowed this $100 million from an overseas bank). Essar would want a full $360 million for its Mesabi business to come out somewhere near whole. Remember that in bankruptcy, CLF offered a whopping $50 million for Mesabi. The CLF CEO said that the Mesabi facilities built to date (at the time of the original bankruptcy) were basically a tear down and worthless. Here we are years later, so the junk built by Essar back then is even more of a teardown.
##############################
##############################
What the vast majority of people here do not realize, especially the shot term traders, is that CLF's stock price history is marked by short periods of very very rapid price appreciation. Anyone looking at the long term price chart of CLF can see this. Along with this comes periods of sharp short term declines and periods of stock price inactivity. The issue to CLF investment participants, especially if you are a short term trader, is that you are probably going to miss the moves unless you have a longer investment time horizon. The price moves are too fast and unpredictable to simply buy the shares quickly and then get out and in the process capture anything even close to the majority of the stock price move. The better approach is a long term one. As a long, holder, you have to be prepared to wait 9 months or longer to get that significant sharp up move. If the move comes sooner, that is just gravy. The holding period through declines and share price inactivity is the cost one must incur in order to be long the shares when the up move comes.

I do not think that we should find this irrationally low CLF stock price too surprising. Large segments of the investing community apparently do not seem to know or comprehend the underlying and enduring value that CLF is building in this steel boom, even though some analysts have provided positive analysis and price targets. Most investors naturally want a financial track record, or they are attracted by some new hyper-high -tech-ultra-green-sounding company. However, I expect many of those heads will turn when CLF makes the next big announcement about Q2 earnings. I think this buying opportunity may persist until that time.

Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc., is ready to take the keys to the long-languishing mammoth iron ore project near Nashwauk.

Several Iron Range legislators would like nothing better than to see the company in the driver's seat.

"They've been saying for quite some time now that if they get the leases and get control of the property, they would do a project there," Sen. David Tomassoni of Chisholm said. "I think what they're saying is real."

Hours after the state of Minnesota announced action to begin terminating state mineral leases awarded to Mesabi Metallics at the site, Cleveland-Cliffs' President and Chief Executive Officer Lourenco Goncalves responded to the state's action.

"Cleveland-Cliffs applauds the move made today by the DNR (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources) to address the long term injury inflicted on the Minnesota Iron Range by people with no agenda other than the goal of extracting benefit for themselves," Goncalves said in a statement. "We also appreciate the relevant support from the Iron Range legislators, the local associations, the Mayors, The United Steelworkers and the population in general. As soon as the legal process of terminating the leases is completed by the State, and assuming that at this time the saga will come to an end, Cleveland-Cliffs is ready to step in and do what we have been doing for decades, by developing Nashwauk and generating a big number of good paying middle-class union jobs for the people of the Iron Range."

The once-promising project near the site of the former Butler Taconite plant stands partially built after nearly two decades of fits and starts by different developers.

Mesabi Metallics had until May 1 to meet a series of milestones established by the state or lose its mineral leases on state lands at the site.

But the DNR said Mesabi Metallics failed to show that it had $200 million immediately available in its accounts as required under a December 2020 master lease amendment.

The DNR also informed Mesabi Metallics that it owes $18 million in minimum base payments for 2020 and that it's initiating termination of the leases. The termination notice is for failure to mine at least 1.6 million tons of ore from state properties in at least two quarters prior to Jan. 1, 2021, failure to complete construction of the pellet plant by the end of 2019, and failure to ship at least three million tons of pellets by the end of 2020, according to the DNR.

Mesabi Metallics has 20 days to cure the lease defaults or the termination action goes into effect, the DNR said.

Frustrated with the project's lack of completion, Iron Range legislators say it's time to move on.

And Cleveland-Cliffs, they say, is the right company to get the job done.

"Lourenco Goncalves is an accomplished businessman, and a man of his word," Rep. Julie Sandstede of Hibbing said. "What he says he will do, he does. Cliffs will build an HBI (hot briquetted iron) plant. These plans are already being developed. They want to be here in Minnesota, but they are prepared to go to Toledo (Ohio). I think it should be here in Minnesota and we cannot afford to drag our feet. Plain and simple, this is business and Cliffs won't sit around waiting. They have a company to run and develop."

Goncalves has in the past expressed interest in building an HBI plant in northeastern Minnesota.

But with state mineral leases at the site awarded to Mesabi Metallics, Cleveland-Cliffs instead built an HBI plant in Toledo. The 1.9 million metric-ton-per-year plant began producing HBI early this year.

DR-grade pellets produced at Cleveland-Cliffs' Northshore Mining Co. processing plant in Silver Bay, made from ore at its Peter Mitchell Mine in Babbitt, feed the plant.

Production of a higher-value product like HBI or DRI (direct reduced iron) on the Iron Range, has long been sought. HBI/DRI feeds the growing electric arc furnace steelmaking segment and can be used as an additive in blast furnaces.

An HBI plant in Nashwauk would create another use for Iron Range ore and bring northeastern Minnesota's taconite industry into a new era.

United Steelworkers Local 2705 President Chris Johnson at Hibbing Taconite Co. is hopeful a Cliffs acquisition of the mineral releases would benefit Hibbing Taconite. The 8.0 million ton-per-year facility north of Hibbing is due to run out of crude ore in the first quarter of 2025.

"I don't think anyone has been told to what extent this will help Hibbing Taconite," Johnson said. "Except that I was told this is the best path for adding mine life to Hibbing Taconite. Nobody has really sat down and laid out a plan for us. We know it will more than likely be rail from there to our property, but even that hasn't been confirmed to the union yet."

Rep. Dave Lislegard of Aurora said via email that as the DNR completes its termination process on the Nashwauk minerals, it would be inappropriate for him to comment on any specifics about potential future leaseholders.

"That said, there is a strong v

I suggest everyone STOP talking about Nashwauk until the lawsuits are settled in about a year, or more.

After that ….. IF ….. the leases are terminated …. the real negotiation with CLF, X and anyone else can start.

We have no idea how long that will take …... IMO another 6 months minimum?

Then….. an environmental study will have to commence and ….. IF ….. the outcome is the same as the current environmental study it could be fairy quick ….. IF NOT …. who knows how long that will take. The current environmental approvals CANNOT be transferred.

Bottom line …. IMO ….. it will be AT LEASE 1½ to 2 years before “someone” is given a go ahead.

Lastly, what will be the status of the steel market be in late 2022 or 2023?

So ….. save your breath, quit speculating and use your abilities to discuss something more germane that might actually happen in the next 1 ½ years.

Well I want to say thank you to all you Shorts. I pick up an additional 15k more shares. This week will be the start of a 6 week up swing. We will be at 25.00 a share as soon as LG makes his update on second quarter numbers. Which will exceed his projections from last quarter. This is a grand slam stock. The shorts are trying to steal your shares before the run up. Sit back and relax and enjoy the ride. One more thing. Monday first thing in the morning the shorts will try to move the needle. But after 10:30am. It’s over.

One view of macro is deflation. I don't see it happening. People have a huge savings right now and the Fed has shown no discipline in printing cash and buying up sovereign bonds. Why, no one wants them around the world at 0 - rates. So, the question is do people, mainly the younger middle aged, hold their cash and grip it like a parashute entangled on the fall..... R you kidding? Laughable... They will like me, spend like a druken sailor. Infrastructure will have to pass, because job creation will have to take place and it will incentivize job creation. This will curb deflation and will allow money flow through our economy. It's a must. When this happens along with all the other Fed printed dollars, what do you believe will happen?

Guys here is the deal. the second Q will be HUGE, the third Q EVEN bigger. June , July HRC still $1500. Decline in outer months means nothing, just like the $850 June futures price was 5-6 months ago. Word in the industry is $1000 the floor over the next few years. CLF coins $$$ at $1000. Infrastructure is a plus. The industry is now controlled by 4 players, pricing discipline combined with strong demand, a home run for CLF, X, and NUE. The auto companies have lost the upper hand. CLF supplies 35% of the industries needs. Can not be replaced !!! All we need to see much higher CLF is the market to hang in there for 5-6 months! STAY LONG!

Think about this ….

Why get 600M more shares?

Might it be to make an offering and use the proceeds to pay down debt?

So …. if there is an impending offering, does it make sense for someone like GS, MS or JPM or anyone else who may want to accumulate CLF, to try to hold the share price down?

Seems like a low SP would be good for them but maybe not so good for CLF or for the longs that just can't understand why the SP isn't increasing.

Just my conspiratorial mind at work.

Take it for what's it's worth.

Dear Gang: I choose this moment to reiterate my previous messages. The map is not the territory.
1. The map (share price) can be manipulated by the heggies, the high speed traders, and the faint of heart.
2. The CLF fundamentals (the territory) remain intact, and are controlled by L.G. and his experts, and they cannot be manipulated. The next several quarters promise astonishing growth, as documented by several expert commentators on this board.
So today's sell off is an act of manipulation. Don't cave in and sell your shares! Stay strong in your belief in fundamentals, in L.G., and the intelligent prospects for CLF! Always look six months ahead, and buy more on this dip as you are able to. Best regards to all longs!

##############################
An interesting pps math projection question. It seems the quarterly Cliffs steel contract updates will work in contemporary HRC pricing but the 2022 on time frame is being postured for when HRC pricing would be more reflective of the post pandemic, new normal. Three HRC steel pricing ranges seem to bracket around what might dominate Cliffs valuation: $750, $1000 and $1250 per ton. I observe the June $1500 per ton actual quotes taper off through the year but $1000+ HRC pricing is printing for 2022 HRC futures, making the $1000 or $1250 HRC averages more likely, but the loss of tariff protection might translate to a difference of $250 per ton on the EBITDA/FCF math, bringing a $750 reference proxy as a low side valuation prospect.

Let’s presume that current market premiums for 2021 let Cliffs balance debt load sufficient to make debt consideration in 2022 drop out of being any significant drag against 2022 pps valuation. Further, I observe the Mesaba Metalics resolution in MInnesota is reflective of an opportunity boost for Cliffs growth that may drag out longer in Courts before viable (we shall see). That leaves the steel market pricing/Cliffs 2022 on contract updates status the primary Cliffs valuation focus.

So what 2022 on pps valuation for Cliffs makes sense for projected $750, $1000 or $1250 average HRC pricing under a presumed “debt balanced” vantage point?

Cleveland-Cliffs signs go up at steel mill, hires more than 710 more workers

5/14 - Burns Harbor, IN – New Cleveland-Cliffs signs have gone up at its Burns Harbor steel mill, acquired last year from ArcelorMittal USA. ArcelorMittal signage came down shortly after the $1.4 billion deal closed in December. New Cliffs signage was just installed, identifying the mill as Cleveland-Cliffs Burns Harbor, including at the main gate and office.

"It's a new day and a new dawn," said U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan, who toured the steel mill in Porter County Monday. "We welcome Cleveland-Cliffs to the community and neighborhood. To have a corporate executive who wants to work with union labor is music to my ears. We need an economy that brings workers and employers together and that's centered around our steel industry. Making sure Cleveland-Cliffs and Cleveland-Cliffs workers have everything they need to be productive going forward is extremely important to me."

Cleveland-Cliffs has hired more than 710 steelworkers at former ArcelorMittal mills since it took over, Chairman, President and CEO Lourenco Goncalves said during a Zoom press conference.

"We want to be here in Northwest Indiana," he said. "We believe in the Midwest and we believe in the state of Indiana. We plan to grow these mills and hire people. Since we have acquired ArcelorMittal USA we hired 710 more people and continue to hire. We're putting in more shifts. We're working to grow this company. We want to invest so we get a return on investment from these plants 10 years from now and 20 years from now."

Cleveland-Cliffs is planning a series of capital investments at the Burns Harbor steel mill starting this year, Goncalves said.

"Burns Harbor is one of our main plants for flat-rolled and plates," he said. "We're planning a series of investments at Burns Harbor, everything from improvements to more protection for the environment to upgrading the blast furnaces. We're going to make a series of investments in the walking beam furnace and the hearth mill. Burns Harbor is one of our flagship plants and we're going to upgrade it over the next two to three years."

Cleveland-Cliffs expects to hire more, as its mills were running at capacity, Goncalves said. The steelmaker just opened applications in Northwest Indiana with the aim of getting 2,300 to 2,500 resumes on file.

"It's a chance for people in our community and neighborhoods to participate in the economy," Mrvan said. "It's a chance to be able to buy a house and have the income to support small businesses. When we look at what Cleveland-Cliffs has done throughout the United States, they are welcome partners going forward."

"Under a best-case scenario, the strong uptrend in steel prices may last until 2022"

“For instance, China has recently removed tax rebates on exports for certain steel products in order to discourage exports while reducing the import duties for certain steel-making raw materials, ” notes the research unit."

'Steel steals the Limelight'

THE recent steep fall in the stock prices of steel-related companies on Bursa Malaysia is likely to be a short-term correction, as the strength in commodities will be supported by the global economic recovery and acceleration in the re-opening phase in various countries, potentially by the first quarter of 2022, which will pave way for a return to normalcy in 2023.

This was opined by Hong Leong Investment Bank head of retail research Ng Jun Sheng, who tells StarBizWeek that given the resurgence in the Covid-19 cases currently, coupled with the slow vaccinations globally, there is ample room for further upside in the commodity’s price trajectory at least until first-quarter 2022 “but we do see bouts of profit taking ahead amidst recent unprecendented rally.”

He also notes that near-term seasonal demand weakness and recovering iron ore supply from Vale (the world’s largest producer of iron ore, pellets and nickel) in the second half could ease prices.

“In the long term though, steel prices should be sustainably higher versus the past few years and be sustainable through to 2022 and 2023, as China (the biggest producer and exporter) aims for carbon emissions peak by 2025. About 18% of carbon emissions come from iron and steel industries. Transitioning to a net importer by curbing domestic production should lend support to steel prices, ” he says.

ADVERTISING

Ng also points out that a long-term infrastructure boom in the United States, driven by President Joe Biden’s massive infrastructure bill, if approved, may sustain strong steel prices.

Steel iron

“Low inventories and slow supply response due to logistics disruptions and capacity resumption are contributing to the struggle of meeting the stronger structural demand globally on the back of China’s robust demand and the proposed American US$2 trillion (RM8.28 trillion) mega infrastructure plan, ” he says.

Rakuten Trade head of equity sales Vincent Lau also sees the recent steel and aluminium-related stocks’ price drop as a near-term correction, following the news flow from China. “The commodities price boom has not ended. Investors can buy on the dip. There is a buying opportunity and it is good to cherry pick companies with strong earnings, ” says Lau.

TA Securities Research analyst Chan Mun Chun agrees, pointing out that steel prices have not weakened and are still at the RM2,800-per-tonne level in Malaysia.

“What is happening is that steel-related share prices are moving ahead in reaction to perceived negative news flow, ” Chan tells StarBizWeek.Over the past six months, steel-related stocks like CSC Steel Holdings Bhd, Hiap Teck Venture Bhd, Ann Joo Resources Bhd, Lion Industries Corp Bhd, Mycron Steel Bhd, United U-Li Corp Bhd and Malaysia Steel Works (KL) Bhd (Masteel) had more than doubled, or even jumped five times from their closing prices on Oct 30,2020.

For example, CSC Steel had closed at RM1.95 on May 4,2021 (from 81.5 sen on Oct 30,2020) while Ann Joo saw a massive jump to close at RM3.08 on May 10,2021 (from 62 sen on Oct 30,2020).

The same skyrocketing trend was also seen over the same period for the stock prices of aluminium producers like Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, LB Aluminium Bhd, PA Resources Bhd and Alcom Group Bhd.

However, the steel and aluminium-related counters have seen steep drops after the first week of May, with the steel-related stocks falling 11% to 33% within a two-week period as of end-Thursday.

Ng explains that the Chinese government had recently signalled intentions “to cool off iron ore and steel prices, and thus negative price action ensued.”

“There were stricter checks on price manipulation and collusion in the steel industry. There were also growing concerns over peaking construction demand in China as we enter the seasonally slow season, and local state bonds issued for infrastructure projects are also lower this year versus last year, ” he says.

Ng also points out that there was a reported all-time high April crude steel production numbers even with intended 30% to 50% production curbs at Tangshan (15% capacity).

“Overall, CISA (China Iron and Steel Association) is targeting a low single-digit decline in production this year. We anticipate stricter curbs to be enforced, given this data release. As a result, on Bursa Malaysia, the steel-related stocks dropped rapidly due to pent-up selling pressure from reaction to the price action in China, ” he says.

Ng notes that the average selling prices (ASPs) of steel have been increasing and generally, price uptrends would expand companies’ profitability margins.

He explains that the key drivers of ASPs i

Steel price is of course cyclical but should remain high longer than expected. Demand will be high with or without infrastructure as empty inventories are replenished and economies reopen. Steel manufacturers have spent heavily on materials and expensive ore and won't be offering much product for sale without recouping expenses. Any drop in price will trigger buyers to take rapid action after learning a lesson recently that delaying purchases can be costly. Extremely likely HRC doesn't dip below $1,000 for at least several years or maybe never.
##############################
##############################
The HRC drop is interesting, but that volume is truly encouraging. The buyers are taking advantage and aren't expecting a massive massive drop. This is a correction that will play out but historically elevated pricing should remain if volume in HRC stays high. The "dam" of bid/spread in the futures market opened up and will cycle through. anything above $1000 is pure gravy here anyway.
##############################
##############################
Steel did a beautiful about face over the last couple days. Its back up above $1600. Demand is back and analysts are getting scared. A few have turned already and gotten on the Bull'ish train and a few are in the HODL pattern. But, there are still some that are remarkably quite in this sector.

Tomorrow is a non starter. But, next week? Look out. Thats not pumping, thats the futures market. Its stairstepping higher.

My theory on the recent slow down on the HRC futures is that the chip supply shortage has created a glut in the spot market as steel producers defer steel supply that was meant to fill auto contracts into the spot market. Once the auto industry gets back to full steam, the supply to the spot will squeeze and the prices will start to rise again. I don't think we have seen the top yet.
At any rate, CLF would have most likely taken advantage of the spot market in the last month or so, so I would expect that they will surpass their Q2 guidance of $1.2B (that's a B as in billion) or adjusted EBITA for Q2.

SO HRC was down big today....BIG deal ! I guess people don't remember JUST 4 1/2 months ago DEC. 2020 HRC was UNDER $700 !!! Now after a three day correction it's down to $1280 !!! Do you have any idea how much money CLF would make at $1200 ???? And off course all earlier MONTHS are much HIGHER !!!! Steel demand is NOT receding. Inflation is getting ready to take off, and yes there will be an infrastructure bill later this year. CLF will rise as the year progress aided by the market's rotation from overpriced growth stocks to low PE Commodity stocks.
##############################
##############################
I don't know this company or steel industry well. Question I have is yahoo here says CLF will make $3.67 this year and only about $2 a share next year. Is that why this is trading at 18.60 a share and could not hold or stay above $2. Is this just one good year and then decreasing earnings? Some here are talking $50 a share. I don't get that if you have a down trend in earnings per share. Trying to understand the stock price and multiple. I got burned years ago buying X and AA at highs, they went boom and bust. Had CLF at $10 sold it at 8. What's different this time? Is this gonna be just another boom and bust cycle.

Banca Ifis rescues Italian casualty of Greensill collapse
By Valentina Za, Giulia Segreti

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy’s Banca Ifis has bought the healthy assets of Aigis Banca for 1 euro ($1.22) after Aigis was forced into liquidation by the insolvency of Germany’s Greensill Bank.

German financial services regulator BaFin in March shut down Greensill Bank AG, which was part of Greensill Capital, the collapsed London-based supply-chain finance group owned by Australian financier Lex Greensill.

“The intervention of Banca Ifis will protect the savings of retail customers, guarantee continuity of finance to businesses and safeguard jobs,” Banca Ifis Chief Executive Frederik Geertman said in a statement.

Milan-based Aigis was established only last December as a specialist lender for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a staff of 50 and three branches spread among Italy’s financial capital, Rome and the southern town of Bari.

At the behest of Italy’s central bank, the Treasury on Sunday ordered Aigis to be put into liquidation, while transferring part of its business to Ifis, which also specialises in SME lending, as well as bad loan management.

Aigis is the first Italian casualty of Greensill’s demise, which also hit clients of Swiss bank Credit Suisse as well as steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance and around two dozen German towns.

You got to love the brazen behavior of Mesabi/Essar. What a bunch of losers. This should be on an afternoon soap opera. Read this press release below and my comments follow.

---------------------------

NASHWAUK, MN -- Just weeks after the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said it would move forward with terminating Mesabi Metallics' mineral leases, the company celebrated its plans to build a taconite and pelletization facility in Nashwauk.

At the beginning of May, the DNR’s ordered the company to prove it had $200 million immediately available for the project. But on May 5, the DNR said that requirement was not met.

In a luncheon celebration Wednesday, the company’s new President and Chief Operating Officer Larry Sutherland said Mesabi Metallics meets all critical requirements from the DNR.

He claimed they have all the money needed to get the project started, they just want confirmation the state will not pull their leases.

"We don't want a legal battle over that," Sutherland said. "We want to resolve this amicably and move this facility forward as everyone in this state should want."

Sutherland said the money was not available at first because of the COVID-19 crisis in India.

"We're committed to, within 48 hours, two business days, to have the rest of that money with the first $100 million we put in, within two business days," Sutherland said. "The company just needs a commitment that those leases are not going to be terminated."

He is confident the DNR's decision will be reversed.

"We're hopeful to work through all of that and move forward, and we need the community's support to do that, and we will finish the construction and start this facility in a timely fashion," Sutherland said.

Also in attendance Wednesday, Nashwauk Mayor Calvin Saari touted the half-built iron ore mine project, which is decades in the making.

"We've waited so many years, the people in this community," Saari said. "Particularly the last 14 years have been so frustrating with this project being on again then off again and another disappointment with it that I think a lot of our citizens and particularly business community got to the point where they lost faith and lost confidence that it would ever come."

The city of Nashwauk has financial stake in the project's success.

"There's been frustrations," Saari said. "We've been deceived many times before, but this is a different set of companies. I'm very very pleased to say that it's been right. The CEOs and the chief executives, the money people behind this, have made an effort to sit down with me and talk several times with it."

Mesabi Metallics said the $850 million project will support nearly 1,000 construction jobs by next spring and add more than 300 long-term jobs once construction is finished.

"The creation of this many jobs is huge for this region, and it will impact this region for generations to come," Sutherland said.

Sutherland said crews can get to work immediately, they just need cooperation from the DNR.

The DNR gave Mesabi Metallics 20 days to prove they meet the requirements or the mining lease will officially end.

The DNR also said they are still reviewing documentation submitted by the company.

They do not have any further comment at this point.

-----------------

my thoughts...

1. So the DNR declares Mesabi/Essar in default on the leases and Mesabi/Essar then proceed to hold a "luncheon celebration"! This is too funny.

2. Mesabi new COO says that Mesabi/Essar has met all the "critical requirements" of the lease. What a bunch of baloney. $200 million was supposed to be injected into Mesabi. It wasn't. The project was supposed to be producing millions of tonnes of iron ore. It hasn't and won't. Etc etc. I love the comment "critical requirements". What a convenient way of saying that they have not met the lease requirements.

3. Mesabi?Essar says that it will not put in the $200 million unless the lease rights are extended. Hilarious. That was not the terms of the agreement. Terms were that $200 million had to be put in by May 5th, 2021. And I love the storyline "we will put in the money as soon as the lease is extended". What a joke. Furthermore, the lease extension agreement called for the full +$800 million in financing to be in place. This financing is not anywhere near being in place.

4. Mesabi rollls out the local town mayor (who was easily paid off with some minuscule political contributions) to glad hand with the new Mesabi COO and to make some incoherent comments about the project.

5. Mesabi clearly indicates that it intends to file lawsuits if the lease are pulled.

6. Mesabi COO says that the project is half completed. There is no way they are anywhere near half done. I suspect that they are 5-10% done with most of that work being related to prior pre bankruptcy expenditures from years ago.

I believe they keep spending knowing interest rates are going up. They will pay a little extra for that Ford Powerstroke and pay lower interest and the extra cost before paying a higher rate next year... JMHO..

We are going to miss out on spot pricing highs over the next few months, but LG made mention that he was already filling his Q2 order book quite some time ago. Q2 is in the books sans spot sales which amount to 15% of sales. If Automotive contracts waned, then CLF sold the steel. Its only been 1 week with weakness in the futures market. I'm pretty confident LG filled the Q2 order book into the rally before last week. Q3 is another story. One would think LG was dipping his toes into that market as well when HRC was north of $1600 thru September.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm glad for the respite in price appreciation. A nice solid reset in pricing followed by a price appreciation run will reset the analysts view on the Steel market.

From what I read, it seems like the swirling positions on CLF by the Jim Cramers of the world might make a Tasmanian devil dizzy. Investment by sentiment may revolve quickly, and investors in that lane might like the adrenaline rush but feel confused. On the other hand, investment based on fundamentals might seem boring, but it makes sense. The fundamentals of CLF seem solid--as detailed by others on this page--especially with current steel and iron ore prices, even though HRC futures dropped this week. If CLF makes the money this year to pay off substantial debt, the value of the company will increase and share value should also. These exorbitant HRC futures prices are a golden opportunity to slash debt, and once that happens, more normal HRC prices should still sustain profitability for CLF. I like the fundamentals, and I expect more people eventually will this summer when they hear about debt reduction, the impressive results from Q2, and they behold a more svelte CLF.

Steel Stocks Are Feeling the Squeeze From China
U.S. steelmakers are sensing just how unhappy China is about high iron ore prices.

Their stocks generally fell on Friday, pushed down by iron ore prices that the Chinese government is trying to rein in.

Friday's iron ore futures prices touched off the stock declines, dropping almost 10% on reports that the Chinese government has asked steel mills to help control the surge in pricing. China is the world's largest steel producer, with roughly 55% of all steelmaking capacity.

Iron ore is a raw material key to making steel. Higher ore prices push up steel prices. Higher steel prices hurt Chinese manufacturers' ability to make money.

Looking forward to the 2022 auto contract pricing negotiations.
The Argus weekly domestic US cold-rolled coil (CRC) assessment increased by $72/st to $1,772/st, while the Argus weekly hot-dipped galvanized (HDG) assessment jumped by $73/st to $1,773/st.
Lead times for CRC were flat at 9-10 weeks from 10-12 weeks, while HDG lead times rose to 9-10 weeks from 8-10 weeks.
Of course, the plate markets look healthy too.
The Argus weekly domestic US plate assessment jumped by $215/st to $1,515/st delivered on a price increase from Cleveland-Cliffs that pushed its fob mill price to $1,490/st. Other plate makers like electric arc furnace (EAF) minimills Nucor and SSAB are expected to announce their own price increase in the next week. Lead times expanded to 7-9 weeks from eight weeks.

From 'FastMarkets'

RESEARCH: US HRC prices may be near peak, but upside risk remains
The latest forecasts from Fastmarkets’ team of analysts are ready to view.

This month’s key North American steel forecast highlights:
Unprecedentedly high flat steel product pricing in the United States was forecast to persist through the current quarter and well into the second half of 2021.
Actual US hot-rolled coil prices in April slightly outpaced our forecasts, with Fastmarkets’ US HRC index averaging $1,390 per ton in April, versus our forecast price of $1,340 per ton for the month.
Upward pricing momentum continued, with prices hovering around $1,500 per ton in early May, supported by persistently tight supply, a lack of spot market availability, extended lead times, strong demand from steel consumers and service centers, with inventories depleted throughout the supply chain, and with restricted supply and higher steel prices globally, which limited both the availability and competitiveness of imported steel.
We maintain both our view that flat steel product prices will peak in May and that any subsequent downturn in flat product pricing will be modest and gradual. Our forecasts of a May price peak may prove to be premature, but this remains our base case expectation.
We acknowledge, however, considerable upside risks for prices in the current inflationary market environment. Depleted inventories across not only the steel distribution chain, but also in key manufacturing sectors such as automotive, will support steel demand for the remainder of 2021, preventing the price collapses seen in previous market cycles.
US steelmakers have abandoned traditional price increases on hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil and hot-dipped galvanized coil, with prices accelerating rapidly albeit without any formal price rises.
In contrast, and reflecting both somewhat slower demand and less severe supply shortages in the plate market, domestic steel plate mills continued to rely on formal plate price increases, with the latest price rise announced in late April.
North American mills were targeting plate price rises of around $60-80 per ton in the latest effort, while they continued to attempt to regain premiums over HRC.
While the latest move will probably prove successful, we do not expect plate prices to reassert their traditional premium over HRC before late 2021 at the earliest.
Domestic long steel product prices showed further gains in April, despite softening prices for obsolete scrap. On multiple mill price rises, long steel product prices were expected to maintain momentum in May, with impressive gains evident across the major product categories.
All indications were that further price increases will be well supported, especially with construction activity accelerating, while manufacturing activity remained buoyant.

Iron Ore?s ?Ridiculous? Prices to Stay as Fear Grips Commodities(Bloomberg) -- Iron ore?s stunning surge won?t fade anytime soon because buyers remain nervous about being caught short as global demand accelerates amid lingering supply threats, according to a veteran commodities trader.The steelmaking material soared past $230 a ton Wednesday to a fresh record for Singapore futures, amid a broadening commodities boom. While steel demand and production are strengthening, many analysts argue market fundamentals alone don?t justify such high prices. That won?t halt further gains, according to Andrew Glass, Singapore-based founder of Avatar Commodities Ltd.?Logic dictates that these are ridiculous prices but fear will continue to keep the scramble going,? said Glass, a former head of ferrous trading at mining major Anglo American Plc, who has traded commodities since the 1990s. ?There is fear of not being able to secure the logistics and the resources you need -- $220 is expensive, but it?s much more expensive if you have to shut down a mill because you can?t get material.?Industrial commodities and shipping costs are spiking as buyers hurry to secure raw materials with global industries from manufacturing to construction gearing up again as the pandemic fades. That adds to strong demand from China, where elevated steel margins are providing support for high iron ore prices. They could test $250 in the coming 12-18 months, according to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.China?s steel and iron ore futures also jumped to record highs Wednesday. The nation?s steelmakers are ramping up production in defiance of government attempts to rein in output to control the industry?s carbon emissions, while robust profit margins are enabling mills to better accommodate surging input costs.Amazing MotivatorIron ore is ?grossly overpriced at the moment, but fear is an amazing motivator and prices are a reflection of fear,? Glass said. ?You?re seeing fear more broadly with gold prices up, the dollar down, there is a flight to safety, and there is a certain amount of fear feeding into commodities markets.?China relies on just two countries -- Brazil and Australia -- for 80% of its iron ore imports. Brazil is grappling with a deadly surge of the coronavirus, and there are global concerns about the Covid-19 variant that?s overwhelming India. Separately, China?s fraying ties with Australia have added another element of risk to the market.?From Brazil, those boats are 40 days away,? Glass said. ?So any more problems in Brazil because of the virus, you better make sure you are well-covered. And if politics between Australia and China does get to the point of creating a problem with Australian supply, and there is a Brazil issue too, then security of supply becomes very, very important.?Iron ore in Singapore rose as much #$%$7% to reach a record $233.55 a ton and traded at $232.20 at 2:25 p.m. local time. Iron ore on China?s Dalian exchange and steel rebar in Shanghai also both advanced to fresh all-time highs.

CLF just incurred a little profit taking and will quickly recover and BE A MARKET LEADER ALONG WITH ALL Companies that benfit from COMMODITIES inflation. Morgan Stanley just upgraded X saying the steel pricing cycle will last longer than people think. ( I think I've been shouting that on this site for months ) .

People here have to understand the scale of the disaster that Essar is facing globally. The scale of the fraud and the collapse are of a massive scale. Mesabi is owned by Essar. I believe that Essar convinced Greensill to provide loans to Essar for payments relating to "future product sales". This was supposed to be "supply based financing" which no other lender would ever do. Here are some headlines...

---------
May 9, 2021

Prashant Ruia chairs Essar Oil UK, parent company of the ailing site

Deloitte has dealt an extraordinary rebuke to the Indian billionaires behind UK's Stanlow oil refinery, raising concerns about money siphoned out of the firm.

The accounting giant said it quit as auditor to the parent company of the ailing refinery near Liverpool because “improvements are required to both the control and the governance framework of the company, in particular regarding loans and advances”.

---------------

May 2 2021

Stanlow oil refinery’s billionaire Indian owners face questions about $225 million (£163 million) that has been shifted out of the UK business, which is struggling to pay a £356 million VAT bill.

Essar Oil UK, controlled by the Ruia brothers, agreed to give their Mauritius-based Essar Oil & Gas a $375 million loan from the Ellesmere Port refinery in 2019. Stanlow has paid out $225 million of that sum but halted further payments as the pandemic struck, crippling oil markets and refining margins.

-----------------
See below about GFG and Essar ...one and the same.

LONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Liberty Steel Group said on Wednesday it had appointed a committee to restructure and refinance the group after Greensill Capital, its biggest lender, filed for insolvency in March.

The move comes after Sanjeev Gupta’s family conglomerate GFG Alliance announced that its Australian unit had agreed terms to refinance its exposure to Greensill.

Liberty Steel, which is also under the GFG umbrella, said in a statement that four new board directors would form a Restructuring and Transformation Committee (RTC) to focus on fixing or selling underperforming units.

“The RTC will be given full autonomy to restructure Liberty’s operations to focus on core profitable units,” it said.

Britain said last month it was allowing Gupta to explore refinancing options before offering any potential government support to Liberty, which employs about 3,000 people in the UK.

The British government had rejected a request for an emergency loan of 170 million pounds for GFG, citing its global spread of operations and opaque structure.

Greensill’s business model has raised concerns and even accusations of fraud. Its main offering was supply chain finance, in which a middleman advances payments to suppliers and then the money is repaid by the buyer. It’s a long-established kind of financing, usually provided by banks, but Greensill added a twist. It packaged the invoices and other receivables by the suppliers into assets that were then sold to investors through funds. The company also provided financing to companies based on “future receivables,” which were based on transactions that hadn’t yet happened.

The London-based finance firm Greensill Capital, one of the world’s biggest providers of supply-chain finance (letting firms borrow to pay suppliers), filed for administration on Monday, saying it was in “severe financial distress” and unable to pay back a $140m loan called in by Credit Suisse, its main backer. It also said it had been hit by defaults from a key customer, GFG Alliance, the global metals and commodities group run by Sanjeev Gupta, which was itself looking financially unsteady and in talks with lenders this week. Greensill’s filing for administration – and potential bankruptcy – marks an astonishing unravelling of a company with close ties to the British establishment (David Cameron is an adviser) and which SoftBank backed to the tune of $1.5bn in 2019. There have been rumours of trouble for months, and the crunch came last week, when Greensill’s main insurer refused to renew a $4.6bn contract and Credit Suisse froze $10bn of funds linked to the firm. It’s bad news not just for Greensill, but potentially for its customers, some of whom may now also be at risk of going under, threatening tens of thousands of jobs worldwide.

From 2017...GFG and Liberty are "Essar"

British-based GFG Alliance, which includes global industrial and metals group Liberty House plus the resources and energy group SIMEC, has stepped up its North American expansion programme with a consortium bid to acquire all the assets of Mesabi Metallics Company LLC – formerly known as Essar Steel Minnesota LLC – and ESML Holding Inc.

This includes a 7m tonnes-a-year iron ore pellet plant at Nashwauk Minnesota with an expansion potential to 14m tonnes a year, plus magnetite resources estimated at 1.968 billion tonnes, with reserves of 1.679 billion tonnes, and hematite mineral resources estimated to be around 352 million tonnes.

Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.

It took about a half an hour, but the computers caught them back up. pretty amazing! do you think the computers have "handlers" or do they just put the code in for the week's trading pattern and hit the beach?

Ok , market tanking, Crypto's tanking, lumber tanking, and YES June, July STEEL UP ! Both over $1500!!!!
If the market continues to tank , yes even CLF will get hit, but if the market stabilizes CLF will be one of the first to hit new highs. DEMAND is driving the price of steel. NOT speculation and Demand will stay strong into 2022.

I have a theory. Might be wacky and I have no proof. But, I hope it stimulates discussion.

Sanjeev is going to the wall and his business is about to be the one that gets executed. In order to stave off the complete implosion of his Empire, Sanjeev Gupta will sell enough of his assets to survive. His Empire will be considerably smaller.

So, here's my theory;

LG is currently directing his lawyers to wade through the impact of acquiring Sanjeev's US assets. Making sure that picking up those wire plants and all the subsidiaries won't trigger the commerce departments 'Monopoly' alarm.

Gupta is on shaky ground with his recent financier as he is now under investigation by the Government and its fraud division.

LG may do nothing. Probably will. But, there is an incredible opportunity simmering right in front of the World of Steel. And, LG likes to acquire distressed assets. Does LG offer a supposed lifeline to Gupta? It won't be for fair value, that's for sure. Liberty Steel USA produces 1.5-2mt of wire rod. For comparison, AKS produces about 6mt and AM USA produces about 10-11mt. We are currently sitting at 5-1/2 billion in debt. Why would LG pay More for Guptas assets? 2mt or about 1/10 capacity of current operation, should be about $1/2billion MAX. Again, LG bought the steel mills under distressed environment.

This sounds about right. And LG has the cash to pull it off, AND still meet his year end goal....easily.

Haven't come to the board for a while, but still holding my long-term shares and only moved my trading money to other stocks.
Reading some comments concerning the drop of the steel price next year. I don't think it will drop much, at least to the end of next year during to the following reasoning.
The current steel price up is driven by a few reasons and below are the main ones.
1. the tension betw Australia and China. China depends on Australian IO by 70% and feels difficult to replace it in a short period because China has poor IO resources and it takes time/capital to increase their capacity which was destroyed in the down cycle in the last decade. With the tension betw the 2, Australian IO pricing strategy would not change and China can't retaliate it with IO. (check coal as an example)
2. China produced 50+% of the world steel in the past decade and part of the products flooded the world market due to the cheap IO price, lower cost(partly due to the missing environmental cost) and government subsidies. All 3 factors are going away which will impact the world supply side.
3. the tension in the middle east and south China sea as well as pandemic reality are triggering an re-organization of the supply chain and increase of demand. In the past, 25-35% of US steel supply came from import. Now, with 232 as a plus, this part of the demand is shifting back to domestic producers, driving up the utilization of capacity to 78+%, the highest rate over the past decade. We will see this trend continuing.

Trading this week has me looking with some respect to the journalists who were bold enough to report out the pending talks between JB’s team and EU parties seeking to rescind tariffs on steel and aluminum. There is a glimmer of hope for reporting when basic “what’s happening” news gets out when timely, even when subsequent posting from investors weighing its significance saw their posts removed on this board, serving to suppress communication on the topic.

That said, I refer back to my observations about unusually high Cliffs trading volume the week before steel tariffs removal was flagged as an active issue by a few in the media. My rough observation was an extra forty million shares traded with the pps in the $20 to $22 range, leaving me wondering if AM was positioning to place the 38 million shares remaining as their payment from Cliffs for the AM US assets. There was also Friday OpEx settlement for minimizing payouts (close $19.5), but the volume was unusually high for just remedying op ex settlement costs. There has been no MT/CLF placement announcements, so I am now figuring that the high volume the week before was likely from parties (hedge funds?) positioning a short in advance of, at that time, undisclosed news that the JB team was consider action to “time out” steel tariffs as negotiations proceed with the EU this year. Today’s SA news that unions and miners are pleading with the JB Administration to keep the steel tariffs in place aligns with Cliffs trading today that pushed the pps down about 10% vs pricing when extra trading volume was observed last week.

Of course, Cliffs is still two months out from when the Q2 results reporting can validate earlier Cliffs guidance citing $1+ billion EBITDA. And the JB tariff discussions suggest 2022 “storm clouds” for the US steel industry. That leaves a few leading questions for me.

1. How important is it for steel industry (in general) financials to retain the steel tariffs if steel pricing remains over $1000 per ton in 2022 on as a “new normal? Some might suggest factors cancel each other out, but my observation is that illegal dumping problems are more fundamental than that.
2. What sort of 2022 EBITDA and subsequent pps projection fits for CLFs, with or without tariffs protection? It seems that might involve running the math with $1000+ HRC pricing presumed and proxying in $750 per ton for the impact of tariffs removal— or something like that.
3. Was the “pre tariff news”, higher than normal trading from last week, the subsequent tariff news releases and trading today coincidental or coordinated as part of the exercising of a game plan? If the latter, I need to reconsider the kudos for media reporting.

Just listened to the replay of X's 1Q call. Very similar theme. Steel prices will remain high LONGER than people think. Maybe that explains the huge move in HRC during the last few weeks. NOW X and CLF, both of which have a cost advantage over NUE, due to the high cost of premium scrap, NEED TO STICK IT TO THE AUTO INDUSTRY. They have stuck it to us for years. PERFECT TIME FOR PAYBACK with auto demand strong, and the economy surging. NO MORE DEALS! $1600 or we sell it on the open market or on the futures market. OUR TIME !!!!!!

US PIG IRON: Market up due to bullish suppliers, increased demand
The United States' pig iron import prices rose further during the week to Friday May 14, with suppliers bullish amid increased demand due to buyers' need to restock.

Fastmarkets’ price assessment for pig iron, import, cfr Gulf of Mexico, US, was at $640-650 per tonne on Friday, up by $15-20 from $620-635 per tonne the previous week.
Offers from Russia was heard in excess of $700 per tonne cfr due to low availability and strong prices in the steel market.

$700/ton for PIG Iron??!!!!!!

So, tell me. CLF sells pellets to the tune of about 4mt externally. 1.5mt makes 1mt of steel. Ru saying we aren't making shtupeed coin at these prices? Thats over $400/ton for pellets. And it only costs about $75/ton.

Also, its costing Cliffy $105 in feedstock to produce steel. Add some coal and other secret sauce ingredients, and its looking like CLF is about 1/2 the raw cost. Give or take.

NUE is paying $625/ton for feedstock. CLF is $105/ton

Reality is coming in a large way come Q3 earnings report. But, Q2 will be no slouch either.

DNR initiates lease termination with Mesabi Metallics
Jerry Burnes May 5, 2021 Updated 5 hrs ago 0
Mesabi Metallics
The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said Wednesday that Mesabi Metallics failed to meet all conditions of a mineral lease amendment and the agency is initiating the process to terminate its agreement with the company.
DNR officials sent a press release announcing the agency’s determination, which said Mesabi Metallics “failed to demonstrate that it had $200 million immediately available in its accounts” as required by a December 2020 amendment.
The DNR said while it is “continuing to review all of the documentation submitted by Mesabi, this failure to meet a fundamental requirement warranted notification that the amendment is not in effect.”
Patrick Hynes, a lawyer and lobbyist representing Essar Global and Mesabi Metallics, said in an statement that the company deposited $100 million into the account, but “because of the unprecedented COVID crisis in India the deposit of the remaining $100 million has been delayed.”
He continued: “Mesabi Metallics is currently spending money from this account in support of the construction project and there will be over 40 new workers on site this week. We are confident that the additional funds will be in the operating account within the next few weeks. The $100 million currently in the account is sufficient to keep the project on schedule.”
Mesabi Metallics faced a May 1 deadline to provide a binding offtake pellet agreement, secure long-term financing of $850 million, of which $200 million was to be immediately deposited in an account for future construction of the Nashwauk project. The amendment was approved by the state’s Executive Council — consisting of the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and state auditor — in December 2020 after a $25 million payment was made to state coffers.
DNR officials confirmed receipt of several documents and submissions on May 1, but said it could take up to two weeks to complete the agency’s review.
In a second letter sent Wednesday to the company, DNR officials told Mesabi that it also owed $18 million in minimum base payments for 2020 and that the agency initiated termination of the leases.
Termination action was taken for a failure to meet a previous lease agreement at end of 2019, which included completion of the pellet plant, mining 1.6 million tons of ore from state properties in at least two quarters prior to Jan. 1, 2021, and shipping 3 million tons of pellets by the end of 2020.
“Mesabi Metallics has 20 days to cure the lease defaults or the termination action will go into effect,” the DNR said in a statement Wednesday, referring to the pellet plant completion, 1.6 million tons of ore mined and 3 million tons of ore shipped in that time span.
The Nashwauk project, which aimed to produce hundreds of jobs, a new mine and steel plant to the West Range region, has failed to deliver on its lofty promise since breaking ground in 2008 under Essar Steel Minnesota. In 2016, the company initiated a $1.1 billion bankruptcy filing that emerged under the ownership of Chippewa Capital Partners.
After numerous CEOs and missed deadlines, former parent company Essar Global purchased Mesabi Metallics’ debt in 2019 to take back its seat as the primary financial stakeholder in the project, but the pattern of missed payments and deadlines persisted.
The return of Essar drew the ire of Iron Range lawmakers, who vocally opposed the December 2020 lease amendment and called for increased scrutiny and safety nets for the project.
Independent State Sens. David Tomassoni of Chisholm and Tom Bakk of Cook recently wrote a bill that would keep permits intact should the DNR want to move on from Mesabi Metallics, essentially providing a safety net for the Nashwauk ore to be mined by a new company without a lengthy environmental review process.
House 6B State Rep. Dave Lislegard, DFL-Aurora, said he would call for a legislative audit of the DNR’s handling of the leases if he felt the agency continued to mismanage the state minerals. On Wednesday, Lislegard praised the agency’s decision and said it moved the project closer to finding a “viable and credible partner” to move forward.
“Today’s announcement validates everything we’ve said about this organization, and what Mesabi Metallics put forth recently was just more in a long line of continued failed promises,” he said. “While we have lost precious time and economic opportunity over the last 13 years, now is the time for us to move forward. I'm extremely pleased that today the DNR has listened to the will of the people of the Iron Range who have been impacted by this bad actor’s inability to meet its commitments.”
Cleveland-Cliffs, which controls a large portion of land and minerals at the project site, is considered the odds-on favorite to obtain state leases should Mesabi Metallics falter again. CEO Lourenco Goncalves has expressed increased interest

CLF leadership seems determined to crush debt ASAP, and they seem well positioned to do so. With current iron ore and steel pricing, cash flow should enable both debt reduction and potential asset acquisition, such as Mesabi Metallics assets in Minnesota, which has been associated with Sanjeev Gupta. Gupta, global steel baron with multiple companies, appears to be struggling with debt, as reported again today in the Financial Times. A primary lending source, Greensill, went bankrupt. Now he is in arrears on loan payments, is selling assets, and is facing headwinds from banks and governments from whom he seeks help. The State of Minnesota should decide later this month if Mesabi Metallics' assets will find new ownership. There could be a liquidation sale. Gupta's pain may well be Cliffs' gain.
##############################

Add more on the open tomorrow. HRC up big today. CLF reversal will be quickly reversed AGAIN on the upside this time. All steel producers agree, this steel pricing cycle will last longer than analysts think. The profitability at these prices is INSANE. There last move in commodities plays is often the BIGGEST !!

##############################
##############################
NUE and STLD can both go shove it. The beauty of owning an integrated steel company like CLF having access to cheap ore, pellets and HBI lies in the degree of profit margin. Who cares how much you get for steel if the raw materials are costing you an arm and a leg? CLF will assume its position on top once the extent of earnings driven by profits margins becomes clear to all.

BTU was at $2+ a month ago, was all the way up to $8+ on May 17, just before the debt/share swap agreement signed on May 18. The shares were issued on May 20. Yet, the sp all the way came down from May 18 to the current $5+ when the swap price is at about $7.85 per share. ($10.99 mil debt / 1.4 mil shares).

What will LG do with 10$ a share or more in earnings after debt is paid off ? Even if steel crashes to 800 ish with no debt he’d still be looking at 5$ a share or more in earnings . Share buybacks and dividends are coming very soon , what could have taken 7-8 years might be accomplished in 7-8 months now . 1/3 dividend ,1/3 buybacks , 1/3 cash . Every single share is going to be exceptionally valued in the very near future either through a huge dividend or a tremendous increase in shareprice , one I don’t think I can quite yet wrap my head around . Cliffs at 21$ with this outlook is as big of a steal as it was at 4$ during the pandemic , except it’s probably more of a sure thing right now .

How much of an impact is futures having on CLF? Think of this.

28% of all steel sales is automotive. That’s the weakest link. 15% is at spot, the so called highest level. The remaining 50% or so is short term contracts.

Basically 3/4ths or 3.1mt of steel is going to sell at $1500+ for Q2. Add some DRI, some HBI, and figure in the automotive.

Automotive scale back truly could not have come at a better time. We trade garbage legacy, trailing pricing for spot pricing! It’s staggering!

Q3, which starts in 7 weeks or so, is going to be a Freight Train!!

So, scuttlebutt of EU-US tariffs, steel taking a breather last week and CLF is going UP??? This is indicative of the narrative is sound but the Market is unsure. Take some frothy out if the futures market and Mr. Market can see clearer what the trajectory will be.

Case in point, we have weakness in the futures market until November. Then the futures pricing has risen. There's your base people. Its $1100. Thats the number I've been quacking about for a spell. Now, I believe, the Market is seeing a new reality in pricing and we are going to see a True Up in SP.

CLF is undervalued because the repubs are blocking the infrastructure bill. What is so hard for you guys to understand? The repubs should have done this infrastructure 4 years ago but they were fixed with boarder wall. The dems even urged them to take the bill that was written and slap their name on it and take credit. But they seem to hate America so hard. CLF investors have been waiting for over 4 years now. They are beginning to sell off. At some point CLF will no longer be undervalued if the dems don't use their "superpowers" to get the bill passed.

Cleveland-Cliffs has mineral rights in that same area, and CEO Lourenco Goncalves had said he wanted to use them to help extend the life at Hibbing Taconite.

We also appreciate the relevant support from the Iron Range legislators, the local associations, the Mayors, the United Steelworkers and the population in general. As soon as the legal process of terminating the leases is completed by the State, and assuming that at this time the saga will come to an end, Cleveland-Cliffs is ready to step in and do what we have been doing for decades, by developing Nashwauk and generating a big number of good paying middle-class union jobs for the people of the Iron Range.'

LG is proving that this can be a $30+ stock from revenues. Next will be proving cost reduction synergies, debt reduction, growth opportunities, or share buybacks/dividends to incentivize long-term holds.

Assuming he can get the 2nd half implemented (and I see no reason why he can't), then in a Hydrogen-powered HBI feedstock BOF/EAF mix future, this can be a $40-50-60 stock.

Playing the aggressive stock + call options game to really juice returns during this bull. Ready and waiting for the peak to transition to a long-term hold coupled with dividends and writing calls/insurance for supplemental cost basis reduction until the NEXT up cycle.

If this company gets out of all the debt and can pay for technology upgrades (more hydrogen-ready HBI) through cash flow?? Well then we are the next Nucor, if not better.

Steel cycle has only begun. Largest users (auto) throttled by chip shortage and will ramp up as that constraint resolves. Massive back orders on large appliances due to labor and supply chain constraints which will also ramp up as we get back to post-COVID normal. Every fake option-driven dip is a buy and a gift at this point.

There is just no excess steel in the world right now. Nobody has it. Service centers can't find it. Why? Because they let their warehouses be depleted when steel was $468/ton. Mo'rRons. Every country is desperate to open their economies and that has sapped the excess supply of steel and created a heightened demand in the spot market. This is real. Its going to get real and in a hurry. Watch pricing over the next 3 months as construction hits full swing.

CLF is going to be much higher and very soon. 3-5 months and the suffering longs will be enjoying Frog Legs

Mesabi Metallics/Essar will not go down without a fight. So they just hired this new CEO a few weeks ago. Who cares. They put a new guy in because Essar has lied to the State of Minnesota yet again and has failed to meet their lease requirements yet again. The old CEO, who sold the State the prior bill of goods, could not go to the State and save face. Too embarrassing and no credibility. Time for a new CEO idiot to take over. The new Mesabi CEO looks lie a total loser to me. So again, Mesabi again failed to meet the lease terms and the period to cure the default is coming up fast (or it may have just passed - I cant remember the default extension date deadline). Mesabi/Essar has so far failed to negotiate a lease term extension, like it has with each of the past 4-5 lease defaults. That means the dynamics currently are a bit different. That said, the politicians generally are easily bought off. A few thousand bucks here or there and you get every local politician saying how great Mesabi is. The problem is that the State sees what CLF is doing businesswise and now understands that CLF is good for its word and would get the job done under budget and on time. So now the battle lines are drawn. Can Mesabi/Essar blow enough smoke up the State's a__ and pay off enough politicians to get the State to provide another extension on the mineral lease? Mesabi/Essar will no doubt have to pony up $20 million or so to the State's coffers if a lease extension is to be negotiated granted. That is money the politicians want so as to pay off their special interests, like the teachers' union. There is nothing that Mesabi/Essar can show on paper to the State to prove that the project has met any of the lease terms. But, if you pay enough politicians off, it won't matter.

Mesabi will be doing an on site dog and pony show for the local bought politicians and no doubt will hire a large number of one-day workers to show the State politicos who visit just how many "fake" jobs will be lost if the lease is terminated. It will all be a staged set up to provide cover for the corrupt politicians to extend the lease.

This will be an interesting few weeks as the State must pull the leases or sign another lease extension. I am not sure how to handicap things as I simply do not have enough knowledge of the State's political landscape, how much Mesabi/Essar can afford to pay for another lease extension. One thing I do know is that the politicians are crooked and are easily bought off.

I am hoping that Mesabi finally bites the dust.

Understanding the tangled web of Mesabi deceit and lack of financing....

Understanding Mesabi/Essar and the current situation requires a sharp mind, attention to detail, and looking through the smoke and mirrors. When you read the article below and your read GFG, understand that GFG is Essar.

3/31/21
The London-based finance firm Greensill Capital, one of the world’s biggest providers of supply-chain finance (letting firms borrow to pay suppliers), filed for administration on Monday, saying it was in “severe financial distress” and unable to pay back a $140m loan called in by Credit Suisse, its main backer. It also said it had been hit by defaults from a key customer, GFG Alliance, the global metals and commodities group run by Sanjeev Gupta, which was itself looking financially unsteady and in talks with lenders this week. Greensill’s filing for administration – and potential bankruptcy – marks an astonishing unravelling of a company with close ties to the British establishment (David Cameron is an adviser) and which SoftBank backed to the tune of $1.5bn in 2019. There have been rumours of trouble for months, and the crunch came last week, when Greensill’s main insurer refused to renew a $4.6bn contract and Credit Suisse froze $10bn of funds linked to the firm. It’s bad news not just for Greensill, but potentially for its customers, some of whom may now also be at risk of going under, threatening tens of thousands of jobs worldwide.

Any buyers on the scene?
According to Greensill’s administration filing, there was only “one credible bidder”, the US private-equity firm Apollo Global Management. Apollo wanted to pay $59.5m for Greensill’s intellectual property and IT systems, in a bid that would involve keeping “the majority” of Greensill’s 500 UK employees. On Wednesday Bloomberg reported that the deal was on the verge of collapse, due to a stand-off with one of Greensill’s key technology providers, the US tech company Taulia. Apollo was only interested in acquiring those parts of Greensill that would give it access to financing lines with large companies such as Vodafone, says the Financial Times. The group had no interest in taking on any financing for Greensill’s largest customer, Gupta’s GFG Alliance. The key sticking point is that, although founder Lex Greensill talked up the firm’s tech prowess, it was ultimately heavily dependent on other companies’ platforms.

Who is Lex Greensill?
He’s the son of a sugar-cane farmer from Australia who put himself through business school in London, built an innovative fintech business, and swiftly found himself at the heart of the British establishment. Now aged 44, Greensill came to the UK in 2001, and in his 20s worked at Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. There, a close colleague and mentor was the late Jeremy Heywood, an ex-mandarin who later returned to government under Gordon Brown, and served as cabinet secretary under David Cameron and Theresa May. After setting up his business in 2011, Greensill became an adviser to the Cameron government on supply-chain financing initiatives in the public sector. After leaving office, Cameron then became an adviser to Greensill, one of very few commercial opportunities he took up. Its collapse is a major financial blow to the ex-PM, who (according to media reports) has stock options worth up to 1% of the business.

What exactly is “supply chain finance”?
The idea is to let big companies smooth out their outgoings and let smaller companies get paid quicker – all courtesy of intermediaries such as Greensill, who lend the money and take a tiny margin. But Greensill is one of a group of businesses that have put a further spin on the idea by selling off loans in order to write more, and packaging supplier debt into bond-like investments. In Greensill’s case, the major customer of the loans was Credit Suisse, which put them into funds sold to outside investors.

That’s beginning to sound risky?
Indeed. Last week Credit Suisse and the other core customer, fund manager GAM, suddenly announced they were freezing the funds, having experienced “default events”. The key to understanding the Greensill crisis is insurance, says Tom Braithwaite in the FT. With insurance covering the credit risk, investors could treat the funds as almost risk-free. But we now know that last summer Greensill’s main insurers, Tokio Marine, got cold feet and sacked the executive covering Greensill for “exceeding his authority” in writing almost $7.7bn of coverage. This year Greensill has failed to find willing insurers and last week failed in a legal effort to force their previous ones to renew the policies. Without insurers to cover Greensill’s credit risks, it’s stuck: unable to offload loans or write new ones. That’s “inconvenient for blue-chip customers such as Vodafone”, says Braithwaite; it’s “potentially devastating for lesser companies” such as those associated with metals magnate Gupta, which are among Greensill’s biggest borrowers.

If you are aware complex steel firms negotiate their sales...its very common to book out 90 to 120 days ahead. I promise you, CLF is taking orders as of today for at least July/August if not longer at.....$1500 T prices! Last earnings report of revenue of $4Billion was on an average of $850-900 ton. Even at those prices, CLF was forecasting end of year rev of $12Billion+...Long story short...Stock is cheap. Good luck longs.

##############################
##############################
Imo reasons for clf recent weakness-
Even bullish analysts expect this year’s steel prices to be peak. Some expect clf to earn close to $5 a share this year but only $2 next year. Market participants are selling on that peak idea.
Steel tariffs may be removed. Market participants are selling in front of that just in case.
AncelorMittal has 38 million clf shares whose lockup expires June 9. They are supposed to give 60 days notice but market participants may be selling ahead of that.
That’s all I have

News article from May 20th that may be contributing to the fall in CLF stock price: "BHP Group’s start up of production at its $3.6 billion South Flank project in Australia -- combined with existing operations at the site -- will create the world’s biggest iron ore hub. It may also help temporarily cool a hot market.

Iron ore futures are trading below $200 a ton after China’s cabinet called for tougher oversight of commodity markets and protection for consumers from soaring prices. While South Flank was a replacement mine, the announcement of a big mine coming on stream can add short-term to negative market talk, according to Peter O’Connor, mining analyst at Shaw & Partners Ltd."

The big rotation is beginning, surely we can pick up some of those investors. Not all will fall into NUE And Dynamics. CLF and X will get their share of newbies. Look for volume to slowly start increasing right along with the share price. Be smart and if you must trade the swings, do so with a small load. Hold you're large position for a windfall! Remember, you don't light a firecraker and reach down and try and pick it back up. You sit back and WATCH it!!!

Heading into 2023 CLF should be a debt free company capable of providing every variety of steel with lowest US cost of production. We can debate where the price of steel sits in 2023 but even a 33% tumble down to $1000 makes the current stock price a small fraction of where it will be going.

Creamer has mentioned Cliff's several times today and really pumping steel stocks along with other Cylicals. Rightfully so! Also, he frowned on Kath Woods words as of late. The comment this evening given to a caller asking about MT and investing in a global steel company. Creamer, tells him he likes the company Cleveland Cliff's who just bought them out... LOL.
As this moves forward CNBC will be talking Cliff's everyday and it's already started.
Creamer also, said, that the Robin crowd he believe's does not even know about Companies like Cliff and NUE, Cat and others in the field. If these every see the light, look out! I predict after Q2 the word will be out and the money should start in earnest rolling in and I would definitely be long. Covering would be smart the next few weeks. JS

Same predictable action every op ex. Either buy the dip or go enjoy the nice weather. Steel market hasn’t changed, demand is not subsiding any time soon, and the positive financial news from LG is still to come. Remember two things: (1) nobody gets fired for saying something that went up will come down and so they’ll keep repeating it until they’re right, and (2) it doesn’t matter because CLF makes a $#!?load of money at far lower steel prices than this.

7 million tons of pellets equals 3.5 million tons or so of HBI. Scrap is at 500$ so at today’s pricing another 1.5 B to 2 B in earnings ? Even with HBI at 250$-300$ that’s a minimum of another billion a year every year after spending a bit over a billion . That’s a pretty solid investment LG made for his shareholders buying Glaciers stake in it . Cliffs could surpass NUE with this in a few years as they did with X this year . Buy and hold Cliffs and let’s all make a lot of money , 20$ a share is still extremely cheap for this company . LG is building an American behemoth in the steel industry from that little nearly BK IO producer , what an unbelievable story!

Hmmm Vlad’s short term long term article issued today, I thought, comes through logic conflicted. How ludicrous to suggest greatness for long term Cliffs pps to then suggest holding off entry when pps is still lower than that being supported by Cliffs guidance updates? Of course—the higher than expected earnings situated to be printed each quarter going forward can be applied to remedy the current debt balance cited as cause for near term concern. The Cliffs acquisition of AM US that closed in December 2020 is a corporate structure game changer that warrants rethinking to consider steel company performance, not the iron ore company whose output of iron ore production now supplies itself, the new Cliffs. The wake up call for analysts is that Cliffs is structured for $1+ billion EBIDA quarters, per CLF guidance updates. Investors can appreciate the guidance math understates impacts from the printing of a HRC futures cycle looking forward over a year. Plus, near term EBITDA has still not reconciled the impacts of steel pricing that is posting at over double historic averages. Forward PE ratios for Cliffs have not yet caught up with those typical for steel peers, leaving CLF under valued from both an earnings and normal steel company PE projection.

I am new to Cleveland-Cliffs, just started my position january 2021. Learning a lot about the industry. I like the fact they are vertical as far as mining, HBI and steel and was surprised to learn they had 4 EAF's. Currently operating 8 BOF with 2 idle. Looking at X and STLD and NUE. Seems overall we are bigger then X very even to STLD although i understand they have some new mills coming online 2nd half this year......and NUE is the gold standard of the industry both in size and consistent revenue. I am strictly using CFRA for 2021 and 2022 Earnings estimates.......to me they seem to be a little more in tune and have a PT of 28 for CLF currently. X 2021 5.51, 2022 1.95. STLD 2021 7.90, 2022 4.10. NUE 2021 10.30 and 2022 4.45. CLF 2021 3.88 2022 3.26.

In my simplistic assumption we should be closer to STLD pricewise and ahead of X. Easy for me to see 40-50 especially if LG just does what he says on debt reduction. Seems all other steel gave a good EPS figure for this year, while LG just gave EBITA figures. I say two more quarters gives clarity and then the analyst will start figuring it out better.

As far as vertical integration i see X owns mines, NUE has scrap sources and i don't know about STLD at all.

Please feel free to correct any of my assumptions as I learn from your comments.

So, why did HRC prices go down today. Did someone magically make a new steel producer? Did some demand suddenly go away?

Confusing.

Mesabi Metallics requests stay of mineral lease termination

The main thing is to have a plan and trade your plan and if the plan doesn't workout you exit and wait for a better entry. You should also know your TARGET. If you are a Buffet-type investor you can just close your eyes and click buy and wait for 3-5 years or more. Most of us are not in that camp. Be careful! Once the tariffs on steel are lifted the steel stocks will drop like a lead balloon.

LG simply has not created a company with an investable stock. If it is going to become one, it will take time.

LG is in a race with the steel market fundamentals: can he reshape the company's balance sheet before the cycle runs out? Of course, that will require that LG keep his ego in check - rather than continuing to build an empire to his legacy.

Yeah, they play their games and we have to go through a few days or a week like this. Meanwhile, every day CLF rakes in more and more money. Unless they are prepared to sell shares on a company selling for less than 3X earnings at some point, we will be just fine.

Futures sitting at $1550.66 for all of Q3!! We keep $1550 for the rest of the year and we will be serious cash flow positive. If our realized pricing can be based on Q1 pricing then a powerful $770+ ebitda per ton is reality. Thats $3.272 Billion ebitda in Q3 alone. Of course if Auto contracts can catch up. But, lets eliminate auto contracts.

Q1 report came in 28% of steel sold in auto contracts. So, 3.02mt sold on short term contracts and at spot. $770 at 3.02 is $2.33 Billion ebitda. No HBI. No Auto contracts. No outside pellet sales. I believe we have $1.5+ billion in Q3 FCF under those numbers. Now add auto and metallics.

1.25mt of auto steel is the number that is hard to figure pricing. Can we get $250 million fcf? I think so.

This really looks like a near debt free company under $1550 to year end pricing. A net debt $1 billion is highly possible. If steel keeps rising higher then net debt $0 is only $125 more over $1550 for H2.

$1675 for all of H2 should do it.

At some point, one would think that a contract for all of a quarter becomes a reliable and reasonable risk. Or does it? If steel hits that $2000 handle, do you just sell, for the next 6-9 months, everything that you can? We are only $450 away from that handle. I wouldn't think the SP would like that, but the monster truck load of cash would be staggering.

Lots to talk about. Thoughts?

Elevated Steel pricing is NOT going away. In fact, give it a week or two. When it starts rising again, its going to have given the market enough time to talk a bit of trash. Then the talking heads are going about face when the pricing elevates.

Lumber is a different story. Its a sheer consumption over supply issue. The spike in consumption was eyepopping. It will come back off its abnormal high. But, its going to cause more pain before it does. Steel, on the other hand, is different. The Whole World is opening from a pandemic. Every country is opening up and using their own steel and buying imports. Its the perfect storm. This will be the case for another year at least.

$30-$35 Q3/CC at the latest. But, I believe there is a real shot for this to hit $30-$35 by Q2/CC. And $55-$60 by year end.

I'll take a Frothy please and make it a triple (digit).

DNR: Mesabi Metallics financing 'unlikely to ever materialize’
##############################
##############################
Debt: Its a major issue discussed at length on this tread. LG clearly has stated he will pay off the 1.6B of ABL debt by year’s end, and also said they have a Plan to pay off the others. I’m sure his financial team can crunch the numbers better than anyone on this board, and come up with the “Optimum” timing to pay it all off! Several variables in the equations FE: interest, penalty fees, tax implication, etc. From a stock value situation, I see little difference (as an example), if by years end, CLF has 5B debt & 5B cash versus 2.5B debt & 2.5B cash versus 0 debt & 0 cash. What’s most important is how they optimize fcf to strategically position CLF for the future. I don’t believe we will hear or see any details of LG Plan this year. It’s reserved for 2022.

Took a clip from an analyst at Seeking Alpha. This is 'Deep Insight', author of the piece.

"CLF was highlighted in Value Investor Insight recently by John Walthausen of the Walthausen Small Cap Value Fund. He shared similar valuation thoughts on CLF:

'Using an average price for hot-rolled coil of $1,250 per ton, we estimate the company this year can earn around $4 billion in EBITDA. It’s now a steel manufacturer so we expect it to be valued comparably to its U.S. steel-manufacturing peers, which based on ten-year averages have traded at around 8x EV/EBITDA. If we use just 5x on our 2021 numbers, the shares would trade at around $34. At the ten-year peer-average multiple, the stock would be in the upper-$50s.' "

Even analysts are starting to pick this up.

By Q4/CC is Feb of 2022 this company will be net debt $1 billion or less. Think on that. Before, CLF had a $2 billion in sales max outlook per year. MAX. Now, its a $10 billion with steel at $600. $15-$20 billion is more like it. A 10X sales jump over just 18 months ago. And they still have the same debt as the $2 billion company. Just......think.....on that. Thats where CLF will be in 9 months. The float has increased by double. Thats all. A 10X sales jump over a double in share count. That's all.

At that point, I expect CLF to be fairly valued with their piers. A fair evaluation of the numbers will divulge the the feedstock pricing advantage that CLF has over NUE. I still am OK with an equal valuation with NUE. Ton for ton and float to float. Thats 60% of NUE currently. NUE has announced a buyback program. CLF will need to keep up to be fairly valued however.

NUE is at $100. I foresee them closer to $125+ by end of year. CLF should be $60+ by then.

May 10 LG CEO CLF
“we are cutting deals way above $1500 per net ton.”

So we have 8 blast furnace. They're all running right now. I say 6 and 8, between 6 and 8, because at any given time, I could have one in repair like I have Middletown for 14 days, or maybe two. But the rule of thumb would be 8. Also if you understood what I was saying during my prepared remarks, we are using HBI in a blast furnace. That's the most sophisticated use of HBI. That's actually why rest of the put their plant in Texas to supply their furnaces in Austria.
So the difference that we put our plant in Toledo to supply blast furnace in the Great Lakes where it's a lot cheaper, a lot simpler, a lot this smarter. So anyway, so that's what we are doing. So we are increasing the throughput with our eight furnaces. We also have that people forget, four EAFs that are running at capacity in a little bit above capacity. And they are Steelton, they are Butler, they are Coatesville, and they are Mansfield.

Any news about demand from around the world is good news for CLF, this from the U.K.

The decision could trigger an increase in steel prices and could impact building projects later this year.

It looks like the steel tariff removal posts are being removed. I will try again...
I was surprised to see news from a financial news network this evening saying tariff negotiations are set to be announced Monday.... Unfortunately, it looks like the JB crew is preparing to throw US mining and steel making under the bus on this one. While catering to the EU threats, the reason is said to avoid retaliatory tariffs on sales of some US brands in Europe.. The JB crew is citing them as “Trump Tariffs” to give political cover. Sad, considering how steel dumping has been such a problem for the US for years and domestic profitability is just getting poised to pay off backlog of debts and resume paying US taxes. Now US miners and steel maker unions need to look inward, to the US manufacturers who are going to place the dumped steel imports into their American products and the politicians who are selling them out.

Last week I said we were $180 away from $1500. Now we are $80 away from $1500 in the futures market for December.

$1545/ton in the futures market thru the end of the year. To be $1100 average for the year, steel would have had to be around $600 for the first 5 months of this year.

GREAT day to ADD to CLF. NUE is up and has given back nothing after a big move from $80 to over $100 during the last two weeks. Over the same period CLF has done very little. WE HAVE A COST ADVANTAGE OVER NUE RIGHT NOW DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF PRIME SCRAP. CLF under valued and the next two Q will show why CLF should be much higher!

##############################
I just reviewed the last three years of HRC pricing (LME Steel HRC N. America-Platts). Take a look. You will not be concerned with HRC shedding a little weight from its highs especially with the foreseeable demand picture.
##############################
##############################
I was hoping $1800 because it was just so ludicrous. Take a pic and hang it on the wall or something obnoxious like that.

This is the first time in months, months(!), that HRC futures have calmed down. The overall opening of the economy is doing just fine. Some inflation in the market is very healthy. Steel was never going to go up forever. We just want it off the bottom.

Steel hits $1650ish and pulls back to the low $1600’s and the stock loses 10%.

Just a refresher. On Guidance, yes guidance alone of $4 billion Ebitda, CLF is sitting at 3X. What??!!

Basically 600 million shares into $4 billion is $6.66/sh for ebitda and we are sitting at sub $20. That’s Under a 3 multiple.

FCF guidance is $2.3billion, the number everyone likes to use, or $4/sh. We are guiding with a 4X handle.

Clearly, the market does NOT believe LG. Mr. Market believes that CLF will barely eke out a profit and go back to the basement dweller it has been for 8 years. The TTM looks like garbage. They don’t have anything else to go on. And that’s why we have the Shorts chirping so loud on this board. They do not believe the outlook that is being guided. Somebody is very right. And, Somebody is very wrong.

I’m basing my outlook on $1000-$1100 steel by EOY 2022. 17mt and $200/ton in earnings. Basically a $6/sh stock. Debt free and an 8 multiple gives me a $48 stock. That is ridiculously Conservative. We are on a path to net debt at $1-1.5 billion by years end. No steel company, NONE, has that kind of balance sheet and stays at a 4 multiple. None. NUE is $97. We are 60% of NUE. But, our debt is a millstone. We will get balance sheet healthy. When we prove it, we will be fairly viewed in the market.

Our earnings has Not reflected the huge pricing upswing yet. It’s jumping next CC and will be finally realized on the books come Q3/CC.

I truly hope that they keep this thing relatively down until next earnings. I’m scraping up powder as we speak.

Pittsburgh — Swelling demand for steel, rather than tariffs, has primarily bolstered surging prices in 2021, as manufacturers adjust to the strong economic recovery following the shutdowns in 2020 caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves said May 10.

Dear gang: I have been with you since $3, and wish to again remind you of the convenient aphorism from my professional life--"the map is not the territory." Think about that. Hedge funds can manipulate the map, raise fears, project calamity, etc. in order to get their 13% interest on shorted shares.
So consider the map as the current share price, and consider the fundamentals of CLF as the territory, which cannot be manipulated.
So hang tough--the territory always prevails! Cheers to my fellow longs!

Where have all the pellets gone???

I'm referring to DR pellets.

My numbers say that in 2019, 2020 and so far in 2021 that about 1,045,118 LT of DR pellets have been shipped to Toledo and in that same time frame about 532,313 LT were shipped to Export.

That's a total of about 1,577,431 LT on 36 boats for a per boat average of 43,818 LT.

Northshore is supposedly capable of making 3.6M LT of DR pellets annually. That works out to 9,863 LT per day.

For the sake of a VERY CONSERVATIVE ARGUMENT I'll assume Northshore produced NO DR pellets in 2019 ….. even though they shipped about 313,418 LT of DR pellets in 2019 ….. I know, I know, that's an illogical assumption …. but bear with me.

So there were 365 days in 2020 and another 129 days so far this year ..... that's a total of 494 days.

IF Northshore produced at 85% capacity (8,384 LT) for each of those days they would have produced 4,141,696 LT of DR pellets.

So …. I'll close how I started …... “Where have all the pellets gone???”

This is the kind of stuff a “boat counter” thinks about when he's not counting boats.

Today Bob Pisani said on CNBC he thinks the commodity cycle had already "played out". I think that's foolish. We haven't even begun the full post-COVID economic recovery and the whole world is currently constrained due to temporary supply chain issues, temporary and artificial labor shortages (due to being paid to not work), etc. This is only the very beginning.

##############################
##############################
I've got a theory thats been floating around this Duck(Bird) brain of mine. Automotive industry has been curtailing the procurement of steel. In turn, the spot market is gobbling it up. Steel is continuing its price appreciation.

What happens when Ford says...'give me back my Steel!'? They take their contracted allotment thereby creating a shortage in the Spot and Short term market through the end of the year.

I just don't think we have seen the end of steel going higher in the futures market. We very well could be looking at $1700 by end of month and $1800 in June. Thats only $168 away mind you.

The NY TAX has caused CLF to drop the last few days. WHAT TAX???
The NY TAX ON AMERICA!!!
NY State created and allows the following:
- High speed trading.
- Naked shorting.
- Algo trading (or computer trading)
- Front running.
- Inside information.

NY State has 15,000 people who pay HALF of all income tax for the ENTIRE STATE of 20 Million.
MOST of this money is HEDGE FUND money!
SO NY not only allows but HELPS the Hampton crowd makes their BILLIONS by cheating the average American. Every year single individuals make over a billion!! THANKS to NY State!!

Does anyone here use front running, algos, naked shorting, high speed trading, etc??? ALL were created for NY hedge funds.

Just saw this from Sentiment trader - they showed how this commodity move has happened 9 times before since 1933 and when you have a "massive supply/demand imbalance" it can be awesome for commodities last four times being 1979, 2007,2008 and 2014 and as they note "commodity bulls would love to see a repeat, as it preceded massive additional gains". So you see my friends this plays right into my thesis and my $50+ target this year. Good day. Boolean

H1 of 2022 is now currently hitting $1290+ average in the futures market. LG guided for $1100 for the rest of 'THIS' year. Next year is $1300???!!!! At what point does the analysts turn bullish and upgrade the sector?

Auto contracts are going to be completely up to current elevated pricing for 2022. $1300 if sold now? Thats got to be the true number of $500+/ton ebitda. $4.25billion in H1 for Ebitda......Right Now!

Hmm, 2021 full year guidance is $4 billion. 2022 H1 futures? $4.25 billion.

We Will come back to earth eventually, but by the time all the analysts can slap each others back about how right they were in forecasting a deflating in the steel market, 'SteelMageddon!', Steel will have hit $17-$1800 and FINALLY drifted back to the new normal of $1300-$1100.

They will all say...'SEE, we told you it was going to deflate. Its dropped 40% in 3 months!!! We were right! We were right!'

And $1100 steel will be the new normal. And all you Longs will have had your generational shot at filling your coffers.

Oh....and steel just might not stop at $17-$1800.

It now appears that HRC is going to average well over $1500 for the rest of the year. And, futures are indicating persistence into 1Q2022. Right now headed over $1400.

I wish there was a true way to have access to every purchase and 'WHY' they buy and sell. The Futures market seems to me to be predominantly the Traders that sold off and booked profits.

Dear Ted,

First, industry consolidation. We bought our customers. Second, a more disciplined supply approach. We can walk away from bad deals....CLF doesn’t do volume for volume sake.
Three, the scarcity of scrap. This will drive pricing higher for the longer term. The large pool of scrap will be consumed by the new EAF coming online. In order to make flat rolled products in EAFs, you need prime scrap and metallics, both of which actually originate from the integrated rock. On top of that, manufacturers have become more efficient at processing high-grade steel, generating less prime scrap to be sold back to the system. The United States is a net exporter of scrap but it is also a net importer of prime scrap. Combine that with China's growing needs for imported scrap...the US EAFs have a big problem. Lower grade scrap is good for rebar but it's not good enough for the production of more sophisticated flat-rolled steel products. This scarcity points to significantly higher prices for scrap.

We formulated this view in 2016 and that has been the driving force behind our strategy for the past five years, including the construction of our HBI plant and our two transformational acquisitions executed last year.

Signed, THE CEO who was placed here by activist investors with alternate plans.

So Ted,

If this is the result of LG's share dilution, then why in the world wouldn't you be an advocate of further dilution?

You see, you opine that it's a negative, and somehow LG is ripping us off, and it is my contention that if it creates value for the stockholder, it isn't dilution at all, it creates value, gains, and wealth.

So why don't you tell the board again how LG is going to rip us off again with further dilution, as I have found, it's a winning bet with this guy.

Hope this explains my post from last week.

Although she had a silver stack the had "Cliffs" Engraved in it with the Cliff insignia, she was not flying a flag that would show her as a Cliff boat.

It’s days like this when I need to look at NUE’s 5-year SP chart for encouragement. Until this super cycle, basically a $40+ stock throwing off ~$.40 divvies every quarter. Sigh, NUE’s been boringly consistent five straight years.

Meanwhile CLF is really only five months old. In the past year it’s gathered the right stuff together so that in the coming months and years it’ll be similarly boring.

The Beach Boys classic, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” is playing in my head as I am reminded we gotta give things time to play out. Hurry up and wait!! We’ll get there.

That tells me that nobody knows whats going to happen next week. I just want this price appreciation to continue above $1600 into and thru Q3 and the CC that come with Q3 in October. 5 months from now with these numbers and futures still rocking, CLF will have achieved my Frothy projections.

CLF continues to show all the correct dynamics for a significant increase in valuation, which will be reflected in a much higher stock price.

1. CLF is operating its business is a highly cost controlled, efficient manner. This is exceptional business practice and something that investors love to see in a company.

2. Steel prices are strong and will remain so in my opinion.

3. There is no threat for resumption of Chinese steel dumping either directly into the US or through slimy third party countries, like Canada and Mexico.

4. The threat of Essar Minnesota (Measbai Metallics) ever resuming its iron ore plans have now been completely destroyed with the exposures of the fraud and the collapse of Sanjay Gupta, Liberty, and all the other related entities (Essar).

5. With focus on climate change and all that stuff, CLF is in the premier iron ore position with its new environmentally clean HBI plant and HBI product.

6. The new HBI plant will be a massive profit machine for CLF.

7. CLF will announce the construction of a second HBI plant once the current HBI plant demonstrates that it is on track to ramp to maximum production.

8. The Mesabi Mettalics leases in Minnesota will be transferred to CLF by the State of Minnesota with its environmental permits intact, allowing CLF to start development of the mining these reserves without lengthy approval delays. Measabi will default yet again shortly and the State of Minnesota has lost patience with Mesabi and their endless lies and dead end promises. CLF will have more than enough free cash flow to develop this leasehold and have huge quantities of low cost, high grade iron ore available for the foreseeable future. Minnesota politicians will cheer the day that CLF is awarded the leases and CLF will deliver on plans to develop this mine and create jobs in the state. There will be huge positive publicity regarding this development.

9. Building any new steel plants in the Unted States will be close to impossible with the use of CLF HBI due to global warming/environmentalist actions. CLF is therefore in the driver's seat as it comes to any new production developments in the steel sector.

10. Any owners of basic steel production facilities (excluding electric arc furnace operators like Nucor) are going to be in a tough spot without having CLF as a partner providing HBI iron ore product over time. This will give CLF the opportunity to buy additional existing steel production facilities at a great price.

11. Nucor s going to run into a brick wall with the lack of steel scrap raw material. CLF has commented extensively about this looking problem, which will drive Nucor's costs up and translate into high end product prices for finished steel.

12. The United States and the government will maintain a strong "buy in America" policy. Anything built in the United States with steel and which uses US Government money or subsidies will have to buy steel from US producers.

13. CLF shares are currently grossly undervalued based on current business conditions and financials, without consideration of any business fundamentals going forward - even those fundamentals past the last quarter's financial results.

14. From a technical standpoint, CLF shares are in the most bullish of formations (a high tight flag).

15. CLF's CEO is slowly being recognized as a masterful businessman, deserving of the utmost confidence and respect. Investors alway want to invest with a leader of this kind.

16. CLF shares are grossly underowned by the institutional investor and retail community. The focus on high flying internet stock has diverted attention away from amazing companies like CLF.

17. CLF will generate so much free cash flow that any concerns over the company's easily managed debt levels or future business expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions will all but disappear.

18. Short sellers are still greatly overexposed to CLF ad have ben losing massive amounts of money. The short sellers have not yet capitulated, which is a good sign for future additional demand for shares

19. Look for CLF to resume its dividend. Any CLF dividend will just add to the attractiveness of the company as a being a good investment. For those who purchased CLF shares at $7 or below, the dividend will be a massive yield on that original purchase price.

@Doug - " Overall, heirs and heiresses make up about half of Western Europe’s billionaires.

Europe’s income classes aren’t much more rigid than in the U.S. The lack of social mobility is more of a concern, though, because economic output and the number of available jobs are smaller. The U.S. has grown 9.9 percent in real terms since 2007; the comparable figure for the European Union over the same period, based on Eurostat data, is 2.8 percent. Gross domestic product per capita in the EU is almost one-third lower than in the U.S when adjusted for purchasing power; the unemployment rate is nearly twice that of the U.S."

I wonder why the EU has growth problems which stymies the social mobility of its citizens?

The IHS Markit US Manufacturing PMI was revised slightly lower to 60.5 in April of 2021 from a preliminary of 60.6 and compared to 59.1 in March. Still, the reading indicated a robust improvement in the health of the US manufacturing sector, and the steepest since data collection began in May 2007. Overall growth was supported by quicker expansions in output and new orders, with the latter rising at the sharpest pace since April 2010. The headline index was also pushed higher by unprecedented supplier delivery delays (ordinarily a sign of improvement in operating conditions). Raw material shortages also led to the fastest rise in cost burdens since July 2008, with firms seeking to pass on supplier price hikes through marked upticks in output charges. Meanwhile, business confidence moderated, amid concerns regarding supply chain disruptions and strains on future production capacity

PD you started off the day loving the action. How do ya like me now? Eco. Is on fire 🔥 and Powell is nowhere to be seen. Gonna be late to the party and interest rates will well overshoot 2%. So by years end looking for hard tapering. Things may be hot until he comes in and puts on the breaks in a big way. Enough to scare the market much more. Housing will not be to good once he gets on up there.. may take a bit though, dont see them coming back to earth after the spike. Its not a good outlook unless you see more printing in 2 or 3 years. Maybe sooner.
Who's buying TB? We use to get a hedge of around 500 Billion from outside help, but not now! Maybe, when rates come back some, but this whole market is a mess IMO. The future is not bright for my retirement or for the dollar IMHO. JS Looking forward to Q2 and Q3.

From just released 10q

scrap, averaged $535 per long ton

Along with these supply-demand factors, pricing for HRC has also risen due to the rise in price of steelmaking input costs both domestically and globally, most notably for iron units. The price of busheling scrap, a necessary input for flat-rolled steel production in EAFs in the U.S., averaged $535 per long ton during the first quarter of 2021, a 70% increase from the prior-year period. We expect the price of busheling scrap to remain elevated due to decreasing prime scrap generation from original equipment manufacturers and the growth of EAF capacity in the U.S., along with a push for expanded EAF production in China. As we are fully-integrated and have primarily a blast furnace footprint, the rising prices for busheling scrap in the U.S. bolster our competitive advantage, as we source the majority of our iron feedstock from our stable-cost mining and pelletizing operations in Minnesota and Michigan. The rising price of busheling scrap should also benefit the profitability of our HBI sold externally, and provide greater cost savings potential for HBI used internally.

Is a 2$ day still gonna feel this good when Cliffs breaks 50$?
##############################
##############################
Today’s trading action serves as a reminder about how much the parties underwriting options trading may be engaging in market trading to influence options expiration payouts rather than investing based on the fundamentals supporting Cliffs valuation. On the one hand, we see B Riley updating their one year outlook for Cliffs to $33 per share. On the other hand, we see about 2 1/2 million shares with of call options positioned to expire in the money today if pps closes below $18 and another 2 1/2 million shares worth of options closing in the money if trading closes above $20 pps today.

That “inertia” against pps movement created by the options risk hedging tool “is what it is”. I observe if the pps jumped up another $2 today it would cost the options players maybe $5 million bucks during settlement. A $4 rise in pps would cost them an additional settlement cost somewhere between $10 and $15 million. Of course, there are parties on both sides of such options trades, but it looks pretty standout when analysts are projecting current Cliffs valuation may be low by about a factor of 2 while trading is being driven to minimize options settlement payout.

Am I missing something here?
##############################
##############################
Here are some 2021 Cliffs value projection thoughts drawn from today’s CLF communications. Please suggest corrections and additions.

Notably, Cliffs increased their EBITDA guidance for CY 2021 by about $500 million to the $4 billion mark, citing increased HRC average pricing of $1100 per ton vs. their March 30, $975 per ton average for the balance of 2021. Cliffs also said the average steel sales price for Q1 was $900 per ton applied to about 4.1 million tons. Further, Cliffs is guiding $1.2 billion EBITDA for Q2, pretty much Unchanged from their March 30 guidance.

Presuming Cliffs is not lowballing their financials to the conservative side (likely they are, but...) today’s Cliffs guidance is suggesting:
- Q2 contracts are set to deliver their $1.2 billion EBITDA per guidance, with the $975 average pricing for HRC figured. Why? Tons sold and EBITDA guidance is not citing any changes from the March 30 update. Hence, no cause to weigh in higher HRC average pricing.
-Average $ per ton only increased slightly between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 ($20 to $30 per ton by my recollection). That suggests the Q2 updated guidance is supported by a larger portion of contracts being updated to reflect the March 30 guidance $975 per ton (Cliffs also told investors such would be the case). Culling out the HRC pricing influence in Q2 needs more information.
-Q3 and Q4 are, by difference, combining to deliver $2.3 billion in EBITDA (4-1.7), assigned to projected sales of just over 8 million tons. The imputed margin per ton steel sold is $288 for the last half of 2021, bundling in non-steel contributions to earnings.
-Back calculating for Q2 EBITDA of $1.2 billion per guidance, the Q2 margin per ton sold is about $300. Of course, steel sales are not the only EBITDA contributions and that value is getting rolled in, assigned to 4 million tons sold.

Cliffs guided $1100 per ton average HRC pricing to finish the year (vs. $975 per March 30 guidance), but I did not see any further detail about the proportion of HRC pricing influencing contracts. The $500 million additional guidance assigned to 8 million tons estimated works out to $62.50 per ton. That is half the $125 difference guided for the average HRC price applied for the last half of 2021.
-In turn, the math suggests Cliffs contract pricing for the last half of 2021 would continue to pick up half of any HRC premiums beyond $1100 per ton HRC pricing until terms are locked down as the timeline proceeds. One might presume this premium continues into 2022 and that the converse applies if HRC pricing starts to drop, as some project. For now HRC spot pricing is $1500 per ton, fueling speculation that Cliffs will find itself outperforming its updated $4 billion guidance for 2021.

I'm going to simplify this for all the math whizzes out there.
Q2 is in the books at around 1.2B EBITDA. You can take about 310M in ITDA off that and divide by 585M to get EPS.
That leaves 2.3B EBITDA for q3-q4
If pricing remains where it's at LG will increase EBITDA guidance with the Q2 release for 2021.
He'll add 500M to guidance taking Q3 to 1.5B EBITDA, leaving 1.3B EBITDA for Q4.
If pricing remains where it's at through Q3 LG will increase EBITDA guidance by another 500M taking Q4 EBITDA to 1.8B.
Q1 500M Q2 1.2B Q3 1.5B Q4 1.8B
5 Billion EBITDA 3.7B profit $6.30 EPS
3.5 billion in debt, an undrawn ABL, and 1 billion in cash.
You need HRC to average 1500 for the rest of the year for that to happen.

Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It
Wayne Duggan, Benzinga
Apr. 28, 2021, 07:50 PM
Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever.

Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks.

History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641.

Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices.

Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices

How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity.

No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days.

“A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note.

Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7."

And where does Cliffy sit? Actually very high according to reported numbers. Not future, but Reported. Thats about to change.

The Biden administration faces a major dilemma in its dispute with the European Union over Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs: back down to avoid acute pain for Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG ) and whiskey distillers or stick with the duties even though they are now exacerbating acute shortages for U.S. manufacturers.The EU has threatened to double the tariffs on Harley-Davidson ( HOG Loading...Loading...) motorcycles, American-made whiskey and power boats to 50% on June 1, cutting off any residual hope of exports to the continent.President Joe Biden has pledged that he will maintain the tariff protections for the steel and aluminum industries until the problem of global excess production capacity - largely centered in China - can be addressed.His sentiments were echoed by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Wednesday, and his Commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said earlier this month that the tariffs "helped save American jobs in steel and aluminum industries."Harley-Davidson ( HOG Loading...Loading...) has also been hit by a European court ruling that its bikes produced in Thailand will be treated as U.S. made, subjecting them to the 50% tariff as well - on top of the normal 6% tariff."If not for the tariffs, which are now threatening our recovering export potential, we could be investing in jobs at our American facilities," Harley Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz told an earnings call. "Instead, we are facing huge tariffs in a trade war - in a trade war not of our making."The Milwaukee-based company is betting heavily on Europe, its second-largest market, to help fuel its turnaround strategy. But higher tariffs would give its rivals including Triumph, Honda ( HMC Loading...Loading...) and Suzuki a massive pricing advantage.In Bristol, Pennsylvania, the craft distiller of Dad#$%$ Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey recently managed to ship its first pallet to a European distributor in over two years after the current 25% tariffs stunted a growing export business in 2018."If you double those tariffs, forget about it. It would be done," Mountain Laurel Spirits LLC owner Herman Mihalich said of his export prospects.STEELWORKERS: HOLD THE LINEThe United Steelworkers union and the mills that employ its members are urging the administration to continue backing the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum, arguing that lifting them would allow subsidized Chinese steel to flood back into the U.S. market via third countries.USW President Tom Conway acknowledged the pain for Harley but said the protections needed to remain in place until Chinese excess capacity was reduced."Some people get hurt when this sort of stuff goes on. So, I understand what they're saying. But I don't think the 232 can be lifted," Conway told Reuters, adding that perhaps the issue could be settled with steel import quotas for Europe.U.S. Trade Representative Tai told senators that she is working with EU counterparts to find a solution, but they must address the issue of excess capacity in China, which produces half the world's steel.She said she hopes that EU officials see the problem "as serious a challenge to their ability to produce and compete in steelmaking as we see it, and working together we will be able to resolve these sets of tariffs so that we can join forces on the bigger picture."The EU has never accepted the premise of the 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs imposed by former president Donald Trump in March 2018, duties based on a Cold War-era trade law to protect domestic industries deemed critical to national security.Critics from the EU to metals-consuming industries and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce argued that the metals were commodities available in ample quantity to meet U.S. defense needs and that European producers in countries that are trusted U.S. allies present no threat to U.S. security.Sabine Weyand, director general of the European Commission's trade section, said earlier this month that she feared the two sides were "running out of time."TIGHT MARKETWhen the tariffs were imposed, the steel industry looked very different from its current supply-constrained condition. Imports were flooding in, taking nearly 30% of the U.S. market, and holding U.S. Midwest hot-rolled steel spot prices below $600 per ton.The goal of the tariffs was to return U.S. steel mills to 80% of capacity use, a level at which they could thrive, and imports sank to around 15% of the U.S. market in January.But this week, amid severe shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic, that spot price is pushing $1,500 a ton, making it cheaper in some cases to import steel and pay the 25% tariff, some steel users say.Steel imports jumped 20.7% in March over February to 2.3 million tons, even though the year-to-date total was up just 3.1%, according to American Iron and Steel Ins

just read X's conference call, per their CEO..."I would say just overall for the -- we had $551 million, we could see as much as double. I don't think it's unrealistic to think that we would double EBITDA in the second quarter from the first quarter." CLF has already flat out stated that they will more than double EBITA, not just double negativing into that it might be possible.
My impression of that leadership team is that they sound very dodgy, like if I owned some shares, I would think about selling. On the other hand, CLF's transcript made me want to go out and buy more shares (except that I am already way over invested).
In other words, X appears to be pleasantly surprised about the current steel prices and are taking advantage of them to actually, finally, turn a profit, while CLF (LG in particular) created this steel market and have positioned themselves to continue to turn a profit perpetually. X is playing checkers and has somehow managed to win a game, while CLF has been playing chess and are now a grand champion!

He cares about the environment, he cares about his employees, most important, he cares about generating free cash flow. Uh, he raised guidance for the second time this year. They are going to end the year with their leverage ratio at 1.0 and then they are going to go even lower. The point being that US as shareholders are going to benefit from more and more of the earnings stream. I previously said I might sell this in the 25 range. NOPE! I’m going to hang on to it.

It looks to me like forward looking assessment of Cliffs prospects can be characterized in four periods, each of which exerts some bullish influence on the share price.
1. Pandemic response and recovery
2. Emergence of the “new Cliffs”, a vertically integrated steel company
3. Global economy catch up with demand for commodities
4. The “new normal” for Cliffs marketing.

A portion of all four of these phase influences are occurring at the same time, which I observe can explain why analysts seem to be having a hard time valuing the stock price. The $33 price target from Riley is showing they are starting to catch on.

Period 1 reaches into early 2020, before Cliffs acquired MT assets, then started to move in earnest with the post November election announcement that C19 vaccines were near ready for broad distribution. Recovery from C19 is a work in progress that may linger a few years.
Period 2 has a born on date of December 2020, but we observe that Q1 2021 is still encumbered by old Cliffs and MT contracts. The full financial impact of the new Cliffs with its seventeen million tons steel production and a few million tons of iron product sales is emerging through Q2, Q3 and Q4 2021. Pps growth in Phase 2 is baked in, trailing behind quarterly contract updating.
Phase 3 is the commodities bubble that is just getting underway since December 2020 as the world tries to catch up after a pandemic year curtailed production while consumer demand for products has resumed, wanting to make up for lost time. Phase 3 is where Cliffs might see $1000 to $2000 per ton HRC pricing, with premiums now looking like they will continue two or three years before supply and demand rebalance. That gives Cliffs enough cash earning potential from pricing premiums to pay off new Cliffs acquisition costs and balance debt to less than one times earnings (LG’s goal).
Phase 4 maybe emerges in 2023 or 2024, where steel production and demand balance and a new, post pandemic normal is what is influencing Cliffs EBITDA. If HRC averages above $1100 per ton for the new normal, investors will see a Cliffs with $4 to $5 billion EBITDA with low debt. FCF over $3 billion a year becomes realistic. Maybe resumption of dividends.

Thoughts? What sort of pps projection is supported as Cliffs steps through to its new normal?

Playing with my earning model again...to get to the $1.2B adjusted EBITA for Q2, I am coming up with Revenue of $4.9B on 4.3mt of steel sold (that is an avg selling price of $1,116/ton + another $140M in HBI sales) that gets me adjusted EPS of $1.30/share.
For full year FY'21 I'm coming up with $18.5B in rev and $3.99 adj EPS (that is on 16.7mt steel @ $1071/ton + $55M in HBI).
For FY'22 (which at this point probably has too many assumptions to mean anything, but...) assuming 16mt steel @ avg of $1,007/ton + $550M in HBI = $16.7B in rev and EPS of $2.07 (that assumes share count of 630M, interest of $280M, and tax rate of 20%). Like I said, too many assumptions, but ball park should be at least $2/share in EPS (not sure how the "analysts" are currently only coming up with $1.38).

Huge day for HRC pricing; over $1400 through end of year (except Dec at 1360). LG may have to bump up his yearly EBITDA estimate by 1B or more. I wonder if he will make everyone wait till June 30, or pre announce earlier?
##############################
##############################
Like clockwork; get it below $18 by 4
##############################
##############################
Starting in May, for the remaining 8 months at current futures pricing and sans April, HRC is averaging $1434.625/ton.

Capex excluded, and using Q1 as a guide of $780/ton cost, we have ~ 12mt left to sell at $654.625/ton ebitda is $7.855.5 Billion in ebitda. That does NOT include the first 4 months of 2021. This equation starts next month.

The FCF generated at Q1 numbers of .575% fcf to ebitda being used as guidance gives a whopping
$4.516 Billion FCF. Of course we have some capex to the tune of $650 million per Koci. Also, Q2 has some headwind per Koci as well. But, its just a few million dollars. And this is all without April's sales.

I just don't see it being this low under these current numbers. At some point, the increased sales become an increased FCF %.
LG clearly states in the CC that any automotive steel he didn't deliver this quarter has been rerouted to the spot market where he made more on margins. He also stated he is selling steel at much higher than $1500/ton.

Q2 and Q3 numbers, if the pricing continues to hold and appreciate, will be the final straw for Mr. Market to assign value to CLF.

Adding April to the mix at $1300, which its been for a couple months now, at $1.4mt/month, $728 million ebitda. May and June at $1514 average is $2.055 billion ebitda. Q2 adds up to $2.783 billion ebitda. Give us a 20% discount to lagging contracts and its $2.22 billion ebitda. .575% of ebitda is $1.28 billion FCF.

I don't know the true discount due to lagging contracts, I'm just trying to be realistic. But, one thing is for sure. If this year holds up to $1500/ton pricing to year end, the remaining of the year, or H2, is going to be $6.12 billion ebitda and an additional $3.5 billion in FCF.

I believe after Capex, we have $4 billion in FCF minimum. Currently 585 million shares for $6.84/sh for the year. A 6X is $41sp. At some point, the multiple will rise dramatically. It will rise over a 10 multiple like it always does in an overheated market. But, I still see an 8-9 multiple under current conditions. By end of year I believe we hit $50-$60.



Just stunning compared to 12 months ago with HRC at an average price of $468/ton.

CLF YTD gain is 461% vs X YTD gain of 325%. Only reason CLF return is higher is because the 52 week low in CLF was $3.80 vs X 52 week low of $6.58. So because CLF went way lower than X makes the YTD gain higher. Who Cares Derek? You rest your return on CLF being a Bigger Terd. Good Job. Whatever makes you happy.

Also I have it on Good authority. LG told the state if Mesabi is allowed to proceed or gets a further extension. He is done with Minnesota and will build his next HBI plant elsewhere (Toledo) but will never give up or sell his lands around Nashwauk. That site will never get developed. It also puts the future of Hibbing Taconite at risk. Let's see if Minnesota can finally pull it head out its.......and do the right thing for once.

The Internet is loaded with Steel articles that are Hyper Bullish. I did find one article that was neutral to negative. But, that article was vague at best about timing. It acknowledged that pricing WA going higher but that steel was in a bubble. Not really a hit piece per se, but they didn't go out on a limb either, so I didn't share it.

We will see $1600 this week IMO.

Lumber futures is beyond the astonishing. Its climbing hard and sitting at $1446.80. The last 2 years average is $582.10. The low was a year ago March at $251. Its been on a steady rise since then but has gone on a meteoric rise this year.

In other words, its not just steel. Its the economy opening up after a Black Swan World Wide slowdown. There will be a catching up from the consumer. But, I don't see it till next year. We haven't even had a summer out of lock down yet. Wouldn't surprise me to see a continued increase in pricing for a few more months if not to end of year. Lumber is at a record in this cycle and steel is at a near record in this cycle as well. When we open up.........uh boy.

What could he do with billions pouring in and negotiating from a position of strength . I’d guess dabbling in the EV market is next or possibly the European steel market shipping excess HBI there to become THE low cost cleanest steel producer there if he could buy some mills very cheaply . I wonder if there might be a steel mill or two on sale there ?

Starting to read ANALysts predicting a leveling off of steel pricing some time in May. It actually is reasonable and have been wondering when this hyperbolic move was going to slow down. But, wouldn’t you know it? Steel futures are now at the $1600 handle.

I was dreaming about $1400 just a month or so ago. $1500 was the dreams of legends! But $1600??!!!

Really? $1600?

If May is the leveling off of pricing, when in May will that happen? Not today. Next week? 2 weeks? End of month? In 3-4 weeks this snarling and drooling Monster just might be at $1800 with this kind of price movement. I didn’t believe we would get to $1600 this quickly. And quite frankly it was a PumperDucks dream to see $1500. Now we are in Euphoria stage pricing...But, I’ll take it!

Run Steel Run! Run to $2000! Then LG can sell steel
In the futures market at ludicrous pricing!

CLF and X are selling at the same PE based on Yahoo Consensus estimates. However, CLF is projected to have slightly higher revenue. With the price of HRC and IO, I find it hard to believe CLF's margins will be much lower than X. That means CLF analysts are just behind the curve in rasing CLF estimates and that should happen over the next few months giving CLF a boost over other steel stocks. It's amazing to me that we are in a histioric bull market for steel and yet anaysts are too lazy to really dig deep into companies like CLF and just wait to see results and only then raise estimates. B. Riley guy seems the only analyst paying attention. CLF is BEHIND the steel group and is due for a catchup move.

Inside KeyBanks Analyst's mind. I recommended CLF and it's doubled in 5 months. I need to record a win, it doesn't matter what happens from here out, I get credit for a 100% gain and a good score on my performance review. So he ignores the MOST important factors namely HRC surging, guidance GUARANTEED to be raised again, inflation, demand, and the comments of ALL steel managements indicating prices aren't going down soon. Now if CLF doubles from here he doesn't get bad grades because he said hold NOT SELL, and he can always seep rising his price target as the stock goes up maintaining his hold. WIMP !!!!

Global Steel Boom Builds as Rampant Demand Overwhelms Supply

The D'Angelo Russell trade has left the fates of the Warriors and Wolves…

(Bloomberg) -- Steel prices are spiking from Asia to North America, and iron ore’s marching higher, as bets on a global economic recovery fuel frenzied demand.

The world outside China is finally catching up with the Asian steel giant’s already strong markets as a global rebound drives a powerful wave of buying that can’t be matched by production. Sectors such manufacturing and construction are ramping up and governments have pledged to splurge on infrastructure as they map their post-pandemic path back to growth.

Mills’ order books are filling up as buyers look to lock in steel after a year of output curbs and idling of plants. On top of that, the biggest iron ore miners have been hampered by operational issues, tightening a market that hadn’t fully recovered from a supply shock more than two years ago.

Here’s four charts that show what’s behind the sudden surge in ferrous markets.

Pricing Power
Prices for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel product, are up threefold in North America from pandemic lows and they’re also soaring in Europe. In China, which has already enjoyed a year of robust demand, steel is the most expensive since 2008.

chart: Steel prices are rallying to multi-year highs in all major markets© Bloomberg Steel prices are rallying to multi-year highs in all major markets
That’s a boon for steelmakers, who are suddenly enjoying healthy margins -- and optimism -- after a miserable year. South Korea’s Posco, one of the top suppliers outside China, just posted its best quarterly profit since 2011 and expects the recovery will continue in the second half on stimulus and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.

Going Global
Worldwide steel demand will grow 5.8% this year to exceed pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Steel Association. China’s consumption, about half of the global total, will keep growing from record levels, while the rest of the world rebounds strongly.

chart, bar chart: Hungry© Bloomberg Hungry
“Lead times are really, really long and some mills are saying they are selling for the third or even fourth quarter,” Tomas Gutierrez, analyst at researcher Kallanish Commodities, said by phone. “There’s optimism on the demand this year with the Covid recovery, and a lot of stimulus plans. Demand outside China in April is higher than we’ve seen in many, many years.”

Material Increase
Iron ore is enjoying a sudden rebound to near-record levels -- spot prices are less than $1 away from their peak of $194 a ton -- as China’s steelmakers keep output rates at more than a billion tons a year to feed still rampant consumption from a busy economy. While Beijing has set a goal of reducing steel production this year, that could prove difficult with consumption as strong as it stands.

chart: China's record steel output has iron ore surging© Bloomberg China's record steel output has iron ore surging
Robust prices have bolstered earnings at the world’s top miners, even as they struggle to supply enough of the raw material. Brazil’s Vale SA churned out less than expected last quarter after lower productivity at one mine and a ship loader fire, slowing its recovery from an early-2019 dam disaster. BHP Group and Rio Tinto Group said quarterly shipments dropped on weather disruptions in Australia.

“There’s a high possibility that Chinese steelmakers will ride the wave of this uptrend and accelerate production, at least this year,” Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. analysts including Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. A long-awaited wave of extra iron ore supply, especially from key shipper Brazil, hasn’t yet materialized as the bears expected.

Making Money
Meanwhile, higher steel prices and China’s effort to clean up its mammoth and heavy-polluting industry with targeted production curbs has pushed profitability at mills to the highest in more than a decade, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge.

chart, histogram: The price spike has handed China's steel mills fat operating margins© Bloomberg The price spike has handed China's steel mills fat operating margins
Steel margins in China “continue to suggest that current iron ore prices are sustainable in the near‑term” and would need to go negative for iron ore prices to correct lower, Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar wrote in a note

so THIS is what it is going to take to unwind the derivatives market in an attempt to make the "transitory inflation"ministers be right instead of wrong?

"Hey Elon you gotta trash everything that is an alternative to the fiat globo-capitalist empire by taking out the head - BTC"

All they can produce is a mild red day in HRC lol. Volume way up on spot orders. That just strengthens the overall steel thesis, when HRC falls heavily on no volume then we can consider if an inflection point has occurred.

And this is all based on $1100/ton guidance at $4 billion ebitda and $2.3 billion FCF. Its going a 'Ton' higher.

I believe we hit $5Billion ebitda and that might be a tad conservative. $50-$60eoy, is my PT for Q4/21/CC.

Ok here is the formula for America. Top rate for individuals 30%, NO deductions except child credits. Corporations, top rate 21%, reduce deductions, 15% minimum tax. Do away with carried interest for hedge funds. To get unemployment benefits you need to actually lose your job and can't find an Equivalent job at equal or better compensation. Proof you applied for jobs every week or you are told where you can get an equivalent job. A minimum tax will not hurt corporations or the stock market. It's a one time hit and the corporations will grow at the same rate once you have the one time hit. NO welfare for able bodied people without either doing some work for it or an effort to get better education toward working SOON. Help for child care for single mother so they can work or get additional education. Aid only for the truly needy, disabled, mental ill, homeless, etc What is the logic of giving $1400 and other $$$ to 85% of Americans when unemployment is just over 6%. Why would you send money to retired and working couples making $150,000 a year ??? INSANE. CUT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. Way too much bureaucracy. Strong borders, a wall, immigration reform. Those hear 5-10 years with no criminal record given a path to citizenship. ALL OTHERS OUT! Democrat states reinstate BAIL for felony criminals. Rioting during protests whether on the right or left strictly enforced. Support and respect police, better training ...YES......Defund....NO !!!

Posco the Korean steel maker is buying a stake in Australian nickel-cobalt mine to expand into battery materials. It offers nickel-cobalt-manganese and lithium-manganese-oxide cathodes as well as graphite anodes.

POSCO Group has identified the secondary battery material business as a new growth engine. POSCO’s secondary battery material business aims to obtain 20% of the global market share and expand sales.

“Why has steelmaker POSCO and its affiliates joined the secondary battery material business? There are three main reasons for this.
The first reason is the significant change in the industrial environment. Demand for secondary battery materials is continuing to increase owing to the rapid growth of eco-friendly mobility business and energy storage systems. Electric vehicles (EV) are in the center of these changes.”

It will be interesting to see and hear X's guidance for the rest of the year and next. They may beat their numbers, but that may be just because the analyst just don't have a grasp of the current market.

What I'll be watching for besides the #'s and the rosy picture of HRC spot, the difference in future CAPEX and their balance sheet. It will be interesting to compare/contrast the different approaches, but more specifically what they will say about their furnaces, both in the US and Europe.

Are they going to spend billions upgrading (needed) their properties? Or will they announce that they will pay down their debt the same way that LG did?

They rarely mention their IO operations, but there is pressure in the industry to move to "cleaner" processes, so would anyone be surprised if they are looking at their own DR and HBI reduction?

If all of their money from the recent pricing upswing is devoted to upgrading their facilities, then CLF will be in a very strong position moving forward.

When does this commodities bubble get popped? Are we close? Is there more room to run?

I did some checking.

Home Depot has a Washer and Dryer set for $1798. I bought an Electrolux set just 3 years ago for $1800. It was within $200 of all the other sets, like Maytag and LG and the like. Looking across all brands and models, HD had a wide range of price points. From ~$500 all the way up to over $1000 for a wash machine alone. What does that tell me? Steel has nearly $0 bearing on appliances and the willingness of consumers to purchase. If the consumer has options, they will 'downgrade' if it gets pricy. But, I don't believe even $1000 wash machine stops the consumer. Young adults buy the entry levels and Empty Nesters purchase the upper end. A $1500 wash machine will stop people in their tracks. But how high does steel have to get to reach that level? The average wash machine weighs 150-250lbs. Lets say 200lbs of steel for agreements sake. 1 year ago steel comprised about $50-$60 of a wash machine. Today, at current steel pricing, its $150. A $100 bump.

Inflation hasn't hit the appliance sector yet IMO. But, when it does, it still won't be ridiculous at this level of steel pricing. $100 just won't move the needle. $200 won't either. You buy a WD set for a 10 year hold. Whats $2-$500 overall?

What will get the market, IMO, is the sale of homes. Also the price of fuel.

Homes are on a tear. Here in the PNW, homes are appreciating at a near 20% clip. Unsustainable.
The narrative is that there are not enough homes to go around. Its a different story but the same reactions to the 2006 housing bubble. In 2006-8 everyone could get a loan and some were getting a 135% LTV on a new purchase. And that was with little to no verification of income. Now? The lending institutions have wised up. But, the interest rates are incredibly low. 2% flat on a 0 points 15 year loan. 1.75% on a .975 points 15 year loan. 30 year loans are only 2.75% 0 points.

When the interest rates start climbing is when the market will heat up. Yeah, I said that right. We get to 3% and that will warm the market even more. How fast do we get to 4%? The FED is going to be highly proactive. But, if inflation takes off, it wont take many months for the consumer to feel the pressure and adjust accordingly. I think we are still several months to a year or more away from that, if at all. I'm hoping its a rise over the summer and a reset back to the $1300-$1500 'new normal'.

Everything else steel is just one component of goods. A 1 ton crew cab truck weighs about 4 ton. At $500/ton thats $2000. At $2000 a ton its $8000. These trucks are $55,000 for a stripped version. $110,000 for the top of the line. Apparently, 4-$6,000 hike isn't detouring buyers. To be fair, with lagging contracts, its probably closer to $1000 a ton right now. Or a $2000 increase in steel. Would you be detoured from buying the truck you need if pricing rose by $2? 4? $6,000 on a $75,000 purchase price? Yeah, me neither.

I don't see the market recoiling at steel prices...yet. Its going to take much higher steel pricing to slow purchasing. I believe over production will take care of pricing before the consumer will. And thats next year. Its not this year.

$2000? Well, that would be a sight. I love $1500. I would take $1100 for a return to the new mean.

COME ON KIDS...settle down. It is not manipulation it is sector rotation. I own stock in almost every sector and I see this constantly where certain sectors go UP and others DOWN...so then the majority of those players go down or up depending on that rotation. Just do a little checking on the sector players and you will see what I mean...yes some will rise or fall more than others depending on news but overall they trade similar depending on being IN or OUT of the sector rotation that day/days/week/ Boolean

Teji Mandi Explains: As China shifts its steel export policy, how will it affect the domestic industry?
By Teji Mandi

With China curbing its exports, Indian steel manufacturers are in a sweet spot to gain the major market share in the international market.
Teji Mandi Explains: As China shifts its steel export policy, how will it affect the domestic industry?

In a major policy shift, China has withdrawn export rebates on major finished steel products and cut import duty on various semi-finished, crude, and scrap steel.

As per the latest announcement, China has removed VAT rebates on exports of 146 steel products from May 2021. It includes key export products like hot-rolled coils (HRC), wire rods, and rebar. China has also cut import duty on pig iron, crude steel, and steel scrap. Further, it has raised export duty by 5% on high silicon steel, ferrochrome, and foundry pig iron.

Decoding the Move

This latest policy shift indicates that China's government is attempting to curb steel exports while concentrating on resolving the domestic shortage. China has been developing this strategy for some time, and this latest step is in line with it. The Chinese government had earlier put restrictions in Tangshan, China’s largest steelmaking city, to keep domestic steel production down in 2021.

China’s withdrawal from the export market will reduce the supply of steel in the global market. The reduced supply will keep steel prices higher in the international market.

As per the Kotak Institutional report, China's steel production growth rate is set to decline from 6.2% in CY20 to 2.6% in CY21 with this move. It is likely to decline further to 1.5% in CY21.

At the same time, global steel use is set to increase to decadal highs in 2021-22E. It is expected to grow to 81% in 2021 from 77% in 2020. It is set to increase further to 82% in FY22.

Considering these tailwinds, China's export curbs have come at the right time for Indian steel manufacturers. The domestic demand is facing troubles due to a sharp increase in steel prices and the second wave of COVID-19. Yet, export markets are thriving given the economic recovery. And, domestic manufacturers have a vast opportunity to expand in that market

Indian steel manufacturers find themselves in a particularly strong position as they have significant room for further price hikes. Domestic HRC prices increased by Rs 5,000-7,000/ton in April 2021. But, it is still trading at a 15% discount to imported steel.

As per the Kotak Institutional report, HRC prices are expected to see a hike of another Rs 5,000-6,000/tn in May-June 2021. With large steel demand expected from the export market, prices of iron ore and other key raw materials are also expected to rise in the coming months.

Closing Comments

With the export market opening up, steel margins are poised for an earning upgrade. With all the economies under the rebuilding phase, a strong supercycle in steel is under making. It offers a great opportunity in this space for investors in the next few years.

Looking at clf’s financials. They reported $513mm in ebitda. Of that $318mm was itda. Earnings excluding non recurring charges was $170mm.

If they expect to make $3.5B Ebitda in the last three quarters. A quick estimate indicates net income will be $2.5B.

Diluted share count is about 550mm.

This would infer they are guiding to to about $4.50 epc for the last three quarters. At a PE of 6, the stock price should hit about $27 once they gain credibility with analysts.

With HRC at $1500 per ton and an estimate based on HRC at $1100, I understand why they are comfortable calling this conservative.

News on CLF on March 31-2021 ""Cleveland-Cliffs' Profit Outlook Tops Expectations March 31, 2021 (Dow Jones) Print""
""On March 31-2021 Cleveland-Cliffs helping to push steel sector stocks higher after releasing profit guidance following the close Tuesday that significantly exceeds expectations. Cliffs is guiding to 1Q adjusted EBITDA of $500M vs. analysts' estimate of $435M, according to Factset. But Cliffs--in rare display of profit visibility for steelmakers--also is guiding to 2Q EBITDA of $1.2B and $3.5B of adjusted EBITDA for all of 2021. Both are above analysts' expectations. The full-year forecast assumes an average selling price of $975 a ton for coiled sheet steel during the remainder of the year. That's higher than many industry analysts are anticipating. As the steel supply and the demand for it become more balanced later this year, prices are expected to fall well below $900 a ton. Cliffs' shares up 15% at $19.86.
(END) Dow Jones Newswires""""
I expect CLF will beat or meet both EPS and REVENUE when releasing its earnings on 4-22-2021. It it does
as the CLF MGT guidance said it would. I see it will pop at least $3.50 at open. I will accumulate more from today's sell-off ( part of the entire markets' sell-off). I will be a buyer from today's deep discount value.
##############################
##############################
I can see just one reason for the stock to be so weak. While I believe the stock should be $22 right now and on it's way towards an eventual $30 and then $34, I can understand why the stock has not left the station.
IT"S THE 2022 ESTIMATES ! look at X and NUE.....same terrible drop in 2022 estimates. Why? I suppose no analyst wants to be open to criticism so none want to state that the current high prices will HOLD.

They could be wrong. But you rarely get criticized for being wrong on the low side, and always get beaten up when you are wrong on the high side. So, CYA. Good luck longs, I am long and strong!

Mesabi Metallics permit bill heard in committee
Essar says it has offtake deal as ownership structure questioned
By Jerry Burnes Mesabi Tribune Mar 24, 2021 Updated Mar 25, 2021 0
Mesabi Metallics permit bill heard in committee
The Mesabi Metallics project in Nashwauk as pictured in October 2017. A bill in the Minnesota Senate would protect permits at the project if the company fails to meet state lease terms.

(Mark Sauer/file)
State senators with the Mining and Forestry Policy Committee on Tuesday held their first hearing on a bill that would solidify permits at the Mesabi Metallics for up to two years should the company fail to meet construction and financing terms set by Minnesota regulators.

Currently, Mesabi Metallics faces a May 1 deadline to produce about $900 million in financing and an offtake pellet agreement. If the company fails to meet the deadline or gain approval from the state Department of Natural Resources, the agency could terminate the mineral lease agreement at the Nashwauk project site.

Options are still holding the shareprice of Cliffs down significantly. In the short term it hurts but long term it’s really a benefit to be able to add shares like a lot of longs here have at 20-30% savings from fair value. How and when shorts leave is entirely up to LG now , he has the weapon in his nightstand and ammo pouring in daily . If he does nothing but pay debt down AND put some portion of that cash into Cliffs vault shorts could be ruined by Christmas. If he dilutes to expand it will take another couple years. It will be an interesting 7 months until 2022 seeing what LG does and how the 40 million shorts react along with the rest of WS.

Listen. Chi a is part of this latest free fall in scaring the Market and allowing Algos to do their corruption. Juat the mentioning of actions taken be the Chicoms have rattled s
Dumb folks. This will not last. I repeat, This will not last. Chi.a pulls this game everytime prices start against them in a flurry. They always post some nonsense to drop pricing so it benefits them in pricing. In a month or so it will be understood that demand is here to stay for awhile and all they have left are lies to sway stupid people, but it works everytime. Same thing happens here everyday in the US with every stock. Depends on what direction they want it to go. Its temporary.
You're Guru Kathy Woodstock, claims its all crumbing down. Just another Tima. I wonder if it benefits her firm to have this happen since its been in freefall!🤔 Why of course a negative out look.helps her and props up her darling tech picks. I hope ination does come Nd wipes the floor qith these liars and Chicoms. You know where the real problem belongs. Hedgies? No really. It belongs to the real power brokers of major companies and Govs around the globe who's word sways the ignorNt and controls the narrative.
Paper hinge on every word and so articles are written. Hedgies just use it to manipulate every wors spoken by these corrupt people. It's all for thwir own gain. Ultimately, the market will play out and they will slow things down. That the intent. They cant stop whats happening, only toss a wrench in it to conflict damage to eveyone on the opposite side. Which is us. If job nu.bers do not increase, inflation will creep. Technology she says has helped in slowing inflation in this supposedly new age, but I will remind her that without technology increases and green energy. You will not move toward carbon neutrality! Period. Without new investment in more mines and new steel, hydrogen tech and better steel operations you will never reach the stated time li es for our global targets. Simple as that. If you stay the course Woodstock, it will cost the developing world, which means a commodity Supercycle and higher prices to get there. End of the story! Thank you.

look at the 5 days charts for both CLF and X, they are exactly the same. Every peak and every valley. That is not natural, there is no way two stocks would trade exactly (and I mean exactly) up and down at the same times for a any amount of time let alone for the last month. 100% manipulation by automated trading. Make your case for long or short, in the short term, it doesn't really matter when it is the computers that are determining which way these stock will trade. But, over time they will. So, if you like the prospects of CLF in the future, go long and wait. If you don't, either go away, or go short and wait.But for Pete's sake, just #$%$ unless you have some actual intelligent intelligence to share!All this blabbing on over who is stupider for their current position is useless since it is the computers that are driving the stock right now.

The light amphibious warships are envisioned as having a length of 200 to 400 feet, a maximum draft of 12 feet and a displacement of up to 4,000 tons, according to the CRS report, which was written by naval affairs specialist Ronald O’Rourke. It will have a transit speed of at least 14 knots and preferably 15 knots. It will be able to operate within fleet groups or deploy independently and is expected to have a 20-year service life.

The Navy’s proposed fiscal year 2021 budget requested $30 million in research-and-development funding for initial industry studies and concept design work. Congress appropriated $24 million.

Vice Adm. William Galinis, commander of Naval Sea Systems Command, said the vessel’s smaller form factor compared to traditional amphibious ships could allow for more industry participation in a competition.

That “opens up the aperture in terms of the yards that would have an opportunity to build this type of platform,” he said during a Defense Writers Group meeting in November. “As we continue to evolve this concept, I can easily see a little bit of an expanded part of our industrial base” that could get the job done.

To reward stockholders CLF may just have to hand out massive dividends after debt is eliminated.

The cc was more than what I expected. LG reviewed strategic decisions that were made over the last five years that were ridiculed by the experts. Reminded the doubters that investment timing is the key and that a top CEO knows the industry best. Held them accountable for misleading the investors.

A capsule of CLF’s strategy that became crystal clear.

1. Invest in future production capacity while others are timid.
2. Purchase assets that competitors are liquidating at bargain prices which they had mismanaged.
3. Sell and/or shut down underperforming facilities. Then redeploy workers on profitable operations.
4. Leverage debt appropriately when interest rates are affordable, then pay off debt quickly when cash comes in.
5. Become the low cost producer through vertical integration.
6. Remind yourself daily that cash is king.
7. Think long term and ignore noise from doubters, short sellers, and investment community “experts” that don’t know industry.

In short this is how you take a near bankrupt company with a pps of $2 to one that can generate $8 per share ebitda.

With HRC pricing holding at closer to $1500 and as HRC futures in 2022 start above $1200 and continuing to rise, the company’s strategy is set to deliver long term profitability.

Let me educate the clueless Analysts downgrading from BUY to HOLD. The three most important factors for CLF or any steel company are as follows: 1. The price of the commodity .....SUPER STRONG, RECORD PRICES.
2. Foreign competition, especially from China..... Tariffs, strong Chinese demand, and the pollution created by producing steel in China, make imports unacceptable and will keep them VERY low. 3. Demand for the product: With the economy recovering, auto, appliance , and then infrastructure driving demand, volume is very good. SO there you have it folks. Lets face it Steel analysts haven't seen a bull market in decades and can't recognize one even when it hits them in the face. STRONG BUY!

CHINA HRC: Prices climb to 12-year high after news of more emissions controls
China’s hot-rolled coil prices surged to a 12-year high on Thursday April 22, triggered by emissions control policy changes in Handan city in northern China.

Domestic
Eastern China (Shanghai): 5,580-5,600 yuan ($859-862) per tonne, up 80 yuan per tonne
Handan city, the second steel hub in Hebei province, had called on steel mills to implement emissions reduction measures by April 30 and stick to them until the end of the second quarter, according to domestic news reports on Thursday.
The news boosted sentiment in the steel sector, with market participants expecting mills in Handan to cut output to ensure lower carbon emissions.

An announcement of increased guidance to $3.5 billion popped this stock to $20+. Then 3 weeks later another increase in guidance to $4 billion. Looks like the market likes it but still is in 'show me' mode. Totally fine with it even though we are 'down $2.50 from previous guidance pop.
If, IF, HRC maintains its elevated price and continues higher, then Q2/CC will finally correlate the SP to the earnings.

$24 at Q2/CC. And if the trajectory continues with HRC pricing above $1500, then $40-$50 by eoy.

Looking at the steel sector. What company stands out as having best potential for upside? If you forget the past, look at the present, and focus on the future, you might might consider stld, x , or nue. But, in a commodity up cycle , there is no doubt, CLF will outperform all of them.

Personally, I believe great CEO’s are a rare breed. Having one is immeasurably advantageous. Ultimately the lowest cost producer will have the highest price to earnings multiple. At a current forward PE of 4-5, a double in SP is not unreasonable.

Sanjeev Gupta pursued by Rio Tinto for $50m over Dunkirk smelter sale
Legal row with FTSE 100 mining giant is the latest headache for the tycoon as he scrambles to save his steel empire

By
Rachel Millard
29 April 2021 • 4:07pm

Sanjeev Gupta is locked in a legal battle with Rio Tinto over $50m in missed payments after it sold Europe’s biggest aluminium smelter to the embattled steel tycoon.

Rio Tinto claimed it is owed the money following the sale of the smelter in Dunkirk, France, to Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance for $500m in 2018.

The FTSE 100 miner launched arbitration proceedings against Mr Gupta in 2019 for the missed payments, which are related to price adjustments that took place after the transaction.

However, talks between the two sides continue.

GFG’s purchase of the smelter was Mr Gupta’s first major industrial deal financed through traditional bank debt and formed part of a wider spending spree as he snapped up tired steel and aluminium assets around the world.

GFG Alliance also bought the Lochaber smelter in Fort William, Scotland, from Rio Tinto in 2016, with backing from the Scottish government.

The legal wrangling with Rio Tinto is the latest headache for Mr Gupta as he scrambles to arrange new financing following the collapse of the supply chain financier Greensill, which blew a $5bn hole in GFG’s finances.

The crisis has left GFG’s UK arm, Liberty Steel, which employs about 5,000 staff, fighting for survival.

Ministers have rebuffed a £170m bailout request from the group, amid concerns over whether taxpayer money would be spent on its UK operations.

Winding-up orders issued by creditors against three Liberty Steel companies were due to be presented at the High Court next week. The hearings, which have now been delayed, have sparked fears that a failure to deal with them could force Mr Gupta’s empire into liquidation.

Alvance Aluminium, the GFG division that now owns the Dunkirk smelter, said the proceedings were a normal part of finalising a sizeable deal.

A spokesman said: “As is usual practice in sizeable mergers and acquisitions, there is a mechanism in place post-completion of this deal to settle the final consideration to be paid to the vendor net of working capital, accounting and other issues.

“This system is ongoing with the vendor as part of the normal process. GFG’s deal to buy the Dunkirk smelter was a successful transaction. The Dunkirk plant is running at full capacity, is delivering to our customers and the outlook for its future remains very positive.”

It comes amid reports that GFG Alliance has been approaching buyers to explore the sale of some of its engineering assets which is largely based in the UK.

Mr Gupta is expected to be called to give evidence to MPs on the business select committee how the collapse of Greensill Capital has affected GFG Alliance.

Just wanted to share a thought with my fellow longs. As I look back about 2 years ago. And remember the days the shorts made me sick on how they keep there foot on all our necks. Well over the past few months we can finally breathe the fresh air. We are on a path of history. An American company come back. I am so impressed with the CLF management team. They have made moves that analysts expected dooms day. It goes to show you that a strong leader with a vision can prove low life analyst wrong. I might have a problem selling this stock even if we got 60.00 a share. But it will be a nice problem to have. Best of luck to all the longs that went for this crazy ride.

Someone early this morning predicted 18.50 for CLF today. It sure looks like that is possible. Many say Options will suppress the stock across the month, keeping it below 18. I have limited understanding of Options, The charts sure look like the Stock could move at anytime into the low 20's. SO, my question for this Expert Panel is: Can the stock move into the low 20's without a major pressor from CLF, ignoring the Option situation? And, are the other steel stocks hindered by Options too?

This is for the guys that no steel making........So we keep talking about if the autos are shutting down we can just sell to the spot market. Is it really that easy? Are the mixes different for auto vs other steels? And if so, does it take much time to turn around a furnace to produce other steels?

So, how does LG get to 1X debt/ebitda? Debt is about $5.4 billion or so. Do we make another $5 billion in ebitda? He said $4 billion for the year based on $1100. LG said thats conservatives. Kofi said thats conservative. So, where does the other $1.5 billion come beyond guidance?

There is 12.5mt left to sell for the year. Thats $125/ton additional ebitda over $1100.

Or, that money comes from somewhere else. Dilution? I don't think so. Not now with pricing going up so fast we can't keep up.

I think LG and Koci believe Steel is going to be much higher than $1100 on the books for remainder of the year. LG seemed to sound like it was a foregone conclusion that CLF would be under 1X.

Many questions. Positive questions.

The following is from a post on AMRN board. Hope this SEC ruling will hit all shorting.
------------
Today is the last day of shorters being allowed to short a stock without having funds in their accounts to cover the trade.

Let us all see if this makes any difference in AMRN's SP . If the stalemated activity continues or a downward pressure is pronounced that would shed light on two players hedge funds or BP purposely holding the SP down. They are probably the only two type of traders that would be capable of trading enough shares to gather sufficient volume to drive stall or move the SP lower. History has shown AMRN dropping at times with no news even being issued.

SEC: on shorting
Rule 15c3-3(b)(3) requires broker-dealers entering into agreements with their customers who lend the broker-dealers fully-paid or excess margin securities to provide the securities lenders with collateral that fully secures the loans.[3] Staff’s letter stated that the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission regarding these programs for six months from issuance of the letter, or until April 22, 2021, to give firms time to come into compliance with the Rule.[4]

Per MT this AM:

"The Company completed a $650m share buyback in 1Q 2021 following the partial sell-down of its equity stake in Cleveland Cliffs. Per its new policy21, a further $570m of capital is being returned to shareholders through a further share buyback program linked to free cash flow generated in 2020 (ongoing and to be completed by year end) and a $0.30/share base dividend will be paid in June 2021, subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM."

MT got about $644Mill selling 40Mill shares. Selling the remaining 38Mill might yield $760Mil @ $20. So sometime this summer (after mid-June), I expect to see those shares sold. CLF will probably hitch a ride for another $20Mill or so.

Then next year, MT will sell off the 50Mill+ shares from the preferred.

Well, it is showtime again for Mesabi Metallics , aka Essar Global, the bankrupt sleaze ball operators. The State of Minnesota has extended the Mesabi lease so many times now, I can not remember. Not once has Essar/Mesabi met the terms of the lease extension from the state. Not one time. Nor have they even come close to meeting any of the set terms.

So here we are again at the latest May 1, 2021 lease deadline. Either Mesabi has secured the required $900 million in financing and signed a secure, fully funded take-or-pay off take agreement for iron ore, or they haven't. The Mesabi webpage has nothing. No updates since 2018. Not a word in the past several days about "meeting the State of Minnesota's lease requirements". So, I would opine that that Mesabi again has failed to meet the lease requirements. We would have heard from Mesabi if such was the case. Any off-take agreement information I have read refers to some third party commodities dealer as being willing to attempt to sell Mesabi iron ore in the US and Europe. Well, that means nothing. I personally could sign up to do that - and of course have no commitment to make any firm buying commitments. As for financing, if Mesabi had secured ANY financing, let alone $900 million, that news would have been broadcasted worldwide in a massive publicity push. Alas, we hear not a peep. There is no financing.

What will the State of Minnesota do now? Will they kick the can down the road another 6 months with yet another lease extension though to 12/31/2021? And then another one, and another, and another? Everyone in the State government knows that this thing is a joke. The issue with the State is that there must been an acceptable "political" solution in order for the State to act. Mesabi and Essar must be throwing just barely enough money at the State to keep the politicians on board. This can be done though many avenues, most notably through simple campaign contributions. At the State level, campaign contributions as small as a few thousand dollars per politician can get the job done to secure the necessary votes for a favorable Mesabi lease extension. Add in some extra cash paid to the State for education, basic service fees, and other, and now you have everyone paid off. At some point this payoff game becomes a political risk to an entrenched politician. Up and coming political aspirants can use this Mesabi payoff scheme and the Mesabi iron ore lease fiasco as a serious weapon to unseat a politician. I am not close enough to the political scene in Minnesota to make any assessment of the situation in this regard. It will take a strong politician, or group of politicians, to spearhead a true effort to end the State's Mesabi nightmare. The politician in such an endeavor must be willing to take some heat and criticism as there will not doubt be mud slung by opponents. It must be clear to the politician(s) that they will come out of any Mesabi lease termination situation with the upper hand. If it is not clear that the upper hand is achievable, why fight the battle? Politicians also know that Mesabi and Essar will probably pursue massive litigation against the State despite the fact that Mesabi has no true case.. This will cost the State significant time and legal expense money. So, the breakeven cost analysis must be such that the benefit to the State from terminating the Mesabi leases must be greater than or equal to the cost (financial and political) to the State for terminating the leases. As every lease extension passes and Mesabi fails yet again to meet the agreed upon terms, the State's cost of defending itself in legal action declines (as Mesabi's case just gets weaker and weaker) and the political cost to politicians rises. This means that the cost/benefit analysis swings ore and more towards the lease termination as far as the State is concerned.

Does anyone have any updates from Minnesota?

@adb2792 you wrote the following a few days ago in a discussion below but let’s flesh this out more if we could.

The company used 585 Mil vs 485 million shares. Do you expect your count to be used?

Is 300 Mil ITDA per q moving forward a fair assumption?

Based on current furnace line up yield is 17 million tons about the max?

Based on LG saying he’s signing deals at $1500/ton and factoring in the supply/demand/inflation/gov spending this number seems right for 2022.
What kind of P/E ratio would you place based on peers?

Would you like to see more contracts in the service center industry with his friends at Reliance/Metals USA?

I’m on the STLD conf call right now. Never heard a more positive outlook on any business. I suggest you listen to it. Per CEO:

- 232 tariffs should remain and any changes will be minor.
- demand is “phenomenal”
- support will “absolute remain tight”
- doesn’t see much import of steel because of int’l steel needs
- record low inventories across industry
- flat rolled prices at record high and 6 months backlog of orders
- Q2 is “going to be multiples of phenomenal”
- auto demand very strong and no impact from chip shortage

I’d say non union steel shops will be understanding what Marty Walsh is up to using OSHA. The DOL has plenty of tools.

“Joe Biden signed an executive order to create a task force in order to promote labor organizing and chose Kamala Harris to be in charge of what is now referred to as the White House Union Task Force.
On Thursday, Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh presented their case on how important more unions are in helping the nation’s economy recover from government-mandated lockdowns.”

“The AFLCIO voiced that through organizing and collective bargaining, unions have gained even stronger protections and rights that have given workers a real voice in safety and health at the workplace. However, this has translated to threatening businesses with strikes or federal inspections in order to get them to comply.”

If ABL is the 1st debt to tackle and 2025 6.75% has stipulating issues tied to paying off debt with share dilution what difference does it make is you sell 20M shares to do so if you are increasing your cash positions by 1B? I for one do not care id the shares are given to tackle that high interest dwbt when cash is offsetting in the confers. LG can buy those back later. Sure the price may be higher to do so,but debt is reduced And it would not take long to do it. The main goal IMO is to get rid of the interest. I'm looking at below 1 to 1 ratio as LG said he would have by year end. So all this negative subliminal massaging means squash to me. Pricing, utilization, PMI, and the CPI along with interest rates and tariffs or quotas are what Im watching. Along with sentiments from Global outlooks. As of now I'm pleased with HRC pricing and flat plate. Galvanized line opening up with even better and more profit coming. Car sales will leap 2nd half of the year or go broke....JS. keep playing the game. Your losing everyday that goes by as pricing remains tight and high. So spew hypothetical scenarios, because I am watching the numbers and right now its rosey.
This year is a washout for those screaming steel bottom. Prices are locking in everyday as we speak and Q1 Q2 2022 are looking even better everyday.
The same f00ls that were belligerent about IO over the last 2 full years are the same ones that are belligerent on steel. They were screaming 50$ IO for years as it rose to 70, 80, 90, 110, 120 before pulling back some and it started over again never falling as they cried and scared everyone into a frizzy. Now look at it. Yea! Do me a favor shut up and move on.

That recent post about a NBC show guest suggesting Cliffs pps maybe being over $35 come first of the year is supported by the updated EBITDA guidance we heard from Cliffs yesterday. Someone also mentioned how op ex max pain is still an issue for today. By curiosity, I surveyed the Cliffs call options running out on the timeline. The options timing out after quarters (July, October and January) show the most open interest but the January 2022 call options are noteworthy. There are over fifteen million shares “in the money” as of today, expiring January 2022. A good portion have a strike price of $10 or less. It leaves me wondering who will be surrendering millions of shares if options expire so much in the money? Reconciling all the options in January could involve $100s of millions changing hands, if I understand how the process works.

That CLF free cash flow analysis discussed here last week still has me considering how the CLF EBITDA guidance for 2021 on March 30 would translate to FCF. Recall the FCF analysis projected a pps valuation in the mid $19s applying a 9.5% discount rate to a ten year outlook. However, the analysis didn’t appear to reflect the March 30 CLF guidance numbers for 2021 (way low) and also projected FCF plummeting in 2022. In contrast, HRC futures are affirming pricing entering 2022 ought to be exceeding the $975 per ton that Cliffs presumed as an average to finish out the balance of 2021, so the analyst projected FCF plunge for 2022 doesn’t appear to reflect projected steel demand.

I am also pondering if FCF analysis should apply for valuing a company that has been reinvesting into its business, like Cliffs. Investopedia FCF tutorial examples suggest not. Reinvestment to bolster future earnings growth (e.g HBI) is supposed to be adjusted into pps projections using the FCF methodology.

That said, FCF generated in the commodity up cycle seems to be positioning Cliffs for FCF much higher than in the FCF mid $19s pps valuation. Results posted by Cliffs this Thursday morning ought to provide sufficient guidance to let investors see some directional confirmation about EBITDA, then from that, FCF.

Slow and steady will win the race from here on out . Inflation isn’t going anywhere with J Carter’s second term being run out , that’s bad for America but good for owning a commodity maker . HRC imho hasn’t hit its highs and in fact we might be seeing the new norm for quite a long time . The best thing I heard from LG yesterday was running efficiently and paying debt . If he does just that putting 2$ to debt along with 1$ in the bank we could and should be entirely debt free by the end 2023 . How big would the dividend be on 5$-10$ a share earnings per year when debt is gone ? A buck a quarter would be my estimate with a few dollars left for capex and building a war chest . A buck a quarter makes this a boring old 100$ a share blue chip hold forever stock .A $6-$7-$8 dividend if commodities stay high would push it much higher than that . That’s why I’ve been here and why I’ve stayed .

$2.3 Billion FCF on $4 billion Ebitda for the remaining 9 months. 12.5mt guided $1100 for remainder of year. That's $320 million ebitda per ton or $780 realized cost on tonnage. FCF is 57.5% of ebitda currently. This is guidance per CC.

Pricing is $1459 average for the Q2 right now.
Q3 average right now is $1456

For every $100 in ebitda, current guiding FCF is $57.5/ton or $230 million in fcf per quarter.
Current pricing is $1459 or $359 above guidance. At 57.5% FCF, thats $206.425 on top of guidance.

At $780/ton all in cost that leaves $679/ton ebitda X 4mt for $2.716 for Q2. LG guided for $1.2 billion. At $1100 guided and $780 cost, that $320 X 4mt for $1.28 Billion.

Its my opinion LG is simply stating an $1100 average for the year and not paying attention to daily futures market. He's got a number in mind he's going to hang his hat on.

Current pricing gives CLF $2.7 Billion for ebitda. 57.5% of that is $1.55+Billion in FCF. I believe a shocker is coming. I'm not counting a dime for HBI. I will count overall pellet sales though. 4mt of pellets at $175 is $100 fcf. IO is $178 for 62%fe. Pellets are much higher than that. I'm being conservative on pellet FCF.

Q2 could have a shocking surprise. $1.65 billion FCF, $1.55billion for steel and $.1 billion for pellets, is a near $3 in earnings. Thats 1 quarter alone. Its all about Q2. Yes, I know, it won't be this high as alot of the steel was sold a month or two ago with steel at $1300, but LG said he's selling steel at higher than $1500. Best to believe him.

If its $1300 for the quarter then its $2.08 Billion ebitda and $1.196 FCF for Q2. Thats $2 for the Quarter.

This is way underestimated by LG and the Analysts know it.

Finally after a few months of moving sideways CLF is ready to move. The last two weeks have produced a dramatic rise in HRC. Investors who thought the cycle would end later this year are forced to recognize the fact STEEL WILL STAY HIGH into 2022 and maybe beyond. NUE, CLF, and others are convinced steel pricing is not going to drop materially for some time. Analysts are realizing it's not too late to recommend steel stocks. I know investors don't get all warm and fuzzy over basic industries that are cyclical and there are not many Analysts following them these days. However, with inflation here and the pollution that foreign steel produces, especially from China, tariffs will continue, demand will remain strong , and CLF is ready to move. Q2 is going to be a monster and guidance will be raised for the third time in 4 months! STRONG BUY! Raising my 2021 est. to $5.00 and price target to $28. 2022 estimate $5.15 and price target $32 in the first Q of 2022.

OK - while a few have hinted at what BOA stated relative to STLD & NUE, you should at least be aware of what they predicted for HRC (relative to what LG said):

"Raising price forecasts as strength extended to Q2E/Q3E

We raise benchmark HRC to $1,077/st from $863 for 2021E and for $1,350 in Q2E from $950 after recent channel checks noted prices rising near term to $1,400-1,600/st, well above a prior peak of ~$1,075/st in 2008."

Interesting to still note: BOA maintains no opinion on CLF - which tells me more financing gymnastics is in the works for CLF.

LG’s headwinds and tailwinds comments on the investor call was interesting LG said there were charges tallying about $100 million giving headwinds to earnings for Q1 and Q2, then same force shifts to tail winds for Q3 on. I didn’t understand that, beyond it helping explain earnings netting lower for Q1, despite the $1/2 billion EBITDA. There were also one time charges of about $60 million associated with Cliffs having paid off debt early.

Does anyone have a sense for when one time charges left from the steel company acquisitions are going to be fully cleared from the books? It seems the one topime charges are mostly done but some are still waiting to post in Q2 results.

Cramer has been neutral to negative on CLF for years. Barely references the company and usually only sith callers bringing it up. Now, CNBC pundits are chirping CLF. Cramer has mentioned CLF no less than 4 times since earnings. He is beating the "BUY" drum. ANALysts are turning the corner and adjusting conservative PT's. IMO, they are being cautiously optimistic. Of course, my name isn't PumperDuck for no reason. I'm a glass half full by nature kind of guy.

I believe that the Steel narrative is far from over. Its got a lot of room to run. $1574 steel....nuf said. $1600 is coming this week. Can we get to $2000? 3 months ago; 1 month ago! I would have said I was being ludicrous. But now, under the current economic environment? I'm tentatively optimistic we get there. I can't believe I just said we could realistically get to $2000 steel.

CFRA MAINTAINS STRONG BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC.
3:43 pm ET April 22, 2021 (CFRA) Print
We increase our 12-month target by $3 to $28, implying an EV/EBITDA of 4.7x on our '21 EBITDA estimate, in line with peers, but a discount to CLF's three-year average forward EV/EBITDA of 8.0x. The current depressed valuations for steel producers reflects a consensus view that the surge in steel prices will be unsustainable and '21 will mark peak earnings. We raise our '21 EPS estimate by $0.70 to $3.88 and keep '22's at $3.26. CLF posts Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.31 vs. a loss of $0.07, $0.05 below consensus; sales were in line with consensus. Q1 adjusted EBITDA beat consensus by 1.3% and the full-year '21 guide was increased from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion in adjusted EBITDA. We forecast free cash flow of $2.3 billion in '21 (all being used to pay down debt), implying CLF is trading at an attractive FCF yield of 26%. Whether the price of steel can sustain its momentum remains an overhang; however, we highlight CLF's new position as a high-margin, top-tier domestic steel producer with a strong balance sheet.

I have made an enormous mistake that I missed last CC. My apologies.

I therefore have been reading the transcript and sharing quotes.
According to LG and Koci, at the last CC, overall Automotive steel production represents 38.5%, NOT 45% of overall production.

Further,

"steel supply contracts are roughly 45% annual fixed price with resets throughout the year and 55% HRC index-linked. That latter piece further breaks down to about 40% on pricing lag, split between monthly and quarterly, with the remaining 15% on a spot basis that currently have lead times up to three months for hot-rolled and four months for cold-rolled and coated products."

Share count is 570 million shares.
Per LG-
"Nucor will be the first one receiving HBI from us in March. And followed by Steel Dynamics, not far from that. And North Star BlueScope will be next"

HBI sales- per LG,
"the numbers that we are working with internally is that we are going to be selling half to the outside world and using half in-house."

Nameplate production is 1.9mt but I'm guessing they can squeeze 2mt/yr. Thats 1MT outside sales at $550/ton. Stunning!!

So, again I apologize for overstating the Automotive contractual tonnage percentage. With that, I will use 40% as my new number for figuring earnings and PT.

CLF has 10 plants and uses only 6-8 at any given time. They are idling the others. I believe we have 17mt for a production target 2021. Thats 5.2mt for automotive remainder of the year. And 8MT for spot. Thats all sans Q1.

8mt at $600 cost but selling for $1400 is $6.4 Billion sans auto steel and HBI and Pellet sales.

$16/sp?? Thats an $11/sh in earnings, people. Thats just spot steel pricing...... Just Breathe... And hang on.

“Icahn Enterprises is exploring the potential sale of its metals recycling subsidiary PSC Metals, according to a source close to the matter.
Ohio-based PSC is currently marketing itself for sale, according to the source, who said that does not necessarily mean it will be sold.”

“Icahn's metals segment, which is entirely comprised of PSC, recorded a profit of $8mn in the 12 months ended 31 March on $347mn in sales. PSC broke even in 2020 and posted a $22mn loss in 2019.

Global steel demand is expected to grow this year at 5.8%. That's great, but I believe it will be even more. China has changed the tariffs on steel imports in hopes of reducing the price of IO with other steels. PI ferrous scrap and on and on. Dropping the small tariff IMO will affect the IO pricing some, but I believe it will be minimal in the short term and the remainder of the next few Qs. It may pull back toward the start of 22, but steel is in huge demand as countries are optimistic on opening and the demand for their own growth will to some degree keep exports down to China. Not completely, but with China's appetite I believe prices will remain very high on steel. Again, they may pull back some, but the demand from opening up will be here to stay for some time. I look for prices to moderate and stay above 1100- 1200 for some length of time. Many countries are looking at infrastructure packages now to start and that will only add fuel to the fire 🔥.
Lead times are ridiculous and may get worse as the openings begin in full earnest. Most mills are already selling into Q3 and Q4 orders going into Q1 2022. Increased production will surely come in the later half of this year, but the demand is and will be insatiable and not be fully met is my belief. Over production will be curbed here in the US. Some are banking on global glut output. Some of this may happen once starting up in some markets, but they are already way behind. Its the nature of the beast and the Pandemic caused all this, so US companies will produce to curb this need. The purposed belief is that there is a fine line being balanced out and its a juggling act for US producers. I beleive it continues and sound judgements on outlook demand and balancing will be the conditions that our CEOs look for and meet without over production.

Another thought: It's my belief that Congress will be in no hurry to pass a infrastructure bill while the lead times and 1st demands post Covid exist. I believe they see and know this and will act accordingly with production rates to keep the economy robust going into 2022 and maybe 2023. Don't be so upset if it's not done immediately. This maybe a huge blessing in disguise. My hopes are to allow pricing to stabilize and retract some and lead times pull back some before the Bill is passed. Timing is everything. Utilization rates are a key metric along with consumer index, production manufacturing index and lead times decreasing. Also, watching for the employment numbers to increase and people starting back to full time work. This is key for the consumer spending to keep up and drive growth. It's now time to stop stupid Government handouts and allow people to go back to full work. If and when we see these things. Look out! Resurgence like you have never witnessed.
Being conservative I'll go along with EPS of 4.3 for the year. I'll take a stab at 2022 and say now that it will be just as good as 2021. Bold, yes, but with infrastructure and the right numbers being passed for the projects that need to be addressed I can see it! Remember the Government needs people working and producing to pay for all these handouts and there is no other way. Growth is a MUST! I repeat!!!! Growth is a MUST!!!!

China has never slowed down and they won't slow now. This goes for all countries. It is a MUST! GDP for global growth will be astounding and we are going to ride this wave of the largest COMMODITY BOOM in GLOBAL History! Watch! Welcome thoughts on you're Global or North American outlooks are welcome. Thanks

LG did not say he was buying back shares...he said he has funding to make moves. that COULD be buying back shares or it could be more aquisitions.

If you listened to the annual meeting, one of the shareholders asked about what the benchmark was to bring back dividends. LG basically said, he is going to increase the stock value through paying down of debt and possibly other acquisitions and THEN when CLF has nothing but cash collecting dust and nothing to buy, then he will reinstate the dividends.

LG isn't finished with the acquisitions...before it's all said and done, LG will make CLFs the number 1 steel manufacturer in the country!

Consider $200 per share within 5 years and then 3% dividends after that...
