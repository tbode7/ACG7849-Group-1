##############################
My average is $23. Don‚Äôt know what to do beside waiting. But for sure still feeling >>>
##############################
##############################
Get rid of any power hungry, greedy management which are increasing their salaries, destroying, share value and spending time with henchmen on BOD play boardroom intrigues and making POWER POINT PRESENTATIONS INTEAD OF SPENDING TIME ON R AND D
##############################
##############################
if luminar goes down velodyne goes down too why?
##############################
##############################
Got back in with 700 shares at $9.19. This is a bargain!!!!3rd time for me. Hopefully, management now knows that we don‚Äôt want to hear about their frictions and inner fighting. SALES, ORDERS, ANYTHING RELATED TO GROWTH will do, thank you. This is a well positioned company with great products, let‚Äôs buy in and give it a chance...Good luck to all

##############################
At the end of day, let‚Äôs try to stay positive, Longs.
##############################
##############################
Long on both VLDR and LAZR. Wish the former had LAZR's management team. Wish the latter had products ready to sell....Patience will win the day....

With all the doom and gloom on this message board lately, you'd think that lidar has no future....NOT!

Here's the news that's fit to print: Velodyne Lidar (NASDAQ:VLDR) reported quarterly losses of $(0.14) per share which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $(0.12) by 16.67 percent. The company reported quarterly sales of $17.70 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $15.81 million by 11.95 percent.

It's called OVERSOLD!!

I‚Äôve Just read my email from vldr sec filing , mr. Hall and his wife were selling some of their shares

##############################
Price is set for patient people to buy and get rich. This stock is gonna get squeezed hard if people hold. It‚Äôs probably shorted more than people realize.
##############################
##############################
The only thing VLDR is good for is a write off against Capital Gains.
##############################
##############################
I opened a position at 16$, sold loss 1$. Yesterday, opened again at 9.16$.
This is lower than IPO price, should be fair and cheap to get in for long term. Go go VLDR
##############################
##############################
Jeez the market really doesn't like VLDR at the moment. Just really weird how just a fortnight ago this was marching towards mid 16's and yet now a daily bleed back to low 11's. Really positive product and partnership news in the last month. I'm just gonna keep on averaging on this one. Currently hold at 12.60, if it reaches 11.50 I'll buy more.
##############################
##############################
Lol this is lower than when it‚Äôs opened back in 2018. We are victims of market manipulation I can guarantee you. Guess the only thing to do here is to hold for a good couple of years until this gets back in the 20s.
##############################
##############################
So earnings today?
##############################
##############################
Folks will wake up and will be late to the party. Lidar is the way to go and VLDR is the leader. Technology takes time to develop into products.

I have said this before and will repeat again: This stock ain't going anywhere until and unless, the power hungry CEO and his henchmen on the board, who sidelined the inventor of LIDAR, also the founder of Velodyne before this SPAC BS, and its major shareholder, is reinstated after the STOP their management intrigues. This has lead to lack of confidence among major potential customers ( like a Ford which liquidated its holdings)

##############################
Last earnings call mentioned contracts for 5 billion in revenue through 2025. LASR has a cooler name. MVIS has Reddit. I'll keep VLDR.

Nice to see this creeping back up after a steady downfall. it really isn't a bad company... just a series of unfortunate events. hopefully the mass of articles o fake "class action" lawsuits fizzle out soon....

Lots of companies partnering with Velodyne, and they'll want to know what's going on before signing up. The fact that they're going ahead makes me think the lawsuits are hot air, nothing's gonna happen!

RADA has radar that will replace VLDR. Cheaper and more accurate.

Is there ever a news story posted on this stock other than lawsuits???.

Too many stocks fell into bargain territory at the bell today, hence the rebound. Not sure why people are beating down on tech at the moment. Most Q1's from the big players are holding up really well. Today saw the resistance level I think. If you bought it at 10.30 well done!!

ambulance chasers scaring people away, these companies signing contracts with vldr know there is nothing wrong or they would look elsewhere

MORE incredible news...and these PR releases are just gonna keep on coming. Shorts are burned on this stock, they need to cover quick , because it's oversold, undervalued and back on the way up!!
##############################
##############################
People finally realizing that this stock was way oversold. It's still cheap, will run back to $20 by next month in my view. Lidar has so much potential in so many area's
##############################
##############################
Looks like the lidar money is coming back to VLDR. A lot of money moving out of hype stocks these last few weeks. Let's hope VLDR with actual solid contracts, products and growth can get back to high teens.
##############################
##############################
Until and unless the power hungry CEO and his henchmen on BOD cease the boardroom
Intrigues and reinstate the inventor of lidar, the founder of the co and the major shareholder
( Mr Hall ) this stock will not breakout to its pre intrigue levels in 20 area.
##############################
##############################
Nice! Higher High's and Higher Low's. All pointing toward a good rebound. When it breaks through the $15.42ish range, you should start seeing strong buying!

Today in Bloomberg news..beginning og he end for power hungry management at VLDR ?
Now we can assume why Ford sold off its stake in VLDR.
"
Argo AI, the self-driving startup backed by Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, has developed a sensor it believes will be key to commercializing autonomous transportation in cities, suburbs and on the highway.

The Pittsburgh-based company, which plans to go public as soon as this year, unveiled a lidar sensor Tuesday capable of ‚Äúseeing‚Äù 400 meters (437 yards) down the road with almost photographic detail. Lidar bounces light off objects to create an image of the road ahead, providing critical information to computers that pilot next-generation technology in vehicles without human drivers.

A lot of talk in recent months about the lawsuits. Let me say this...if a company like Gatik or any other signs a multi year agreement with Velodyne, then they're gonna do their due diligence, and that would include asking some tough questions about what's happening, and requiring full disclosure. So whilst we're not privvy to the details, I'm pretty confident that companies who want be partners with Velodyne are, and it looks like they have confidence in the company.

Any one looking for industry and company to 10 fold return, they wont find in Cloud or Fintech or EV cars.

On other hand, I am quite certain one of these EVTOL (likely multiple) will go 10 fold. ( I like $RTP, $QELL, $EH, $ACIC all of them because this is one of sure field that not to distance future everyone will talk about)
One of Solid State Battery ( $QS is most likely name) go 10 fold.
One of this LIDAR company ( $VLDR I like most) go 10 fold.

All of this selling for huge

##############################
##############################
Can someone explain this?
VLDR was green while all other lidars are red. And now, by announcing a new multi-year agreement, VLDR is red while all other lidar players are green?
Someone understand it?

What is going on with VLDR, good business model, signed good contracts, believe there only to be upside once EV world kicks in anyone agree? All this negative news is just market spanking Spacs until real revenue comes in but we are heading there so stay for long.

He lead the company for much of its existence and it wouldn't be where it is without him.... that being said, how many customers does the company have right now? Are they putting these LIDARs in every Chevy or Nissan starting from 2022? No. And the only reason for that is the cost of these devices. If they spend too much time on making the absolute best product, they will lose the opportunity to gain market share, and it will become an uphill battle. So while he has a point, and we don't have specifics as to where they might be compromising in order to cut costs, the SPAC and CEO also have a duty to shareholders to deliver, and that's what their aim is. No automaker is going to shell out $500 a unit for these unless its for a $100k Lexus, but the goal is to get some volume and take this mainstream as quickly as possible, not for it to be a luxury feature on 100k cars. So while respecting the founders opinions on his own company which he built, they should be bringing him back on board and he needs to let the board and management do their jobs.

Looks like everyone wants a piece of the lidar pie again. Lets be blunt....irrespective of what caused the Tesla crash, there's no way autonomous driving can be based solely on camera based systems. Lidar units to accompany a camera system will be a much safer solution!!
##############################
##############################
great close for vldr over $14 as someone else posted this could rise 30% in no time, look at the charts and decide for your self. but great existing and new cutting edge lidar solutions and big multi-year contracts signed almost every other month. with expectations low, i think longs are all in a good place. VLDR is a good one to own and not feel bad when it goes down in price.

Folks that watched the Robots on 60 Minutes last night did not relate Ladar to the dancing Robots. Ladar is the future and the Two stocks best to capitalize is VLDR that has the most uses currently for Ladar and LAZR that is far behind in applications of the technology uses. Recent shake up of management is good for the Company presenting a buying opportunity. VLDR is in so many applications from traffic control, drones, automotive and heavy equipment control to mention a few. Wonderful long term investment for a retirement portfolio.

##############################
I was off a bit on my $15 prediction for a close this past Friday but the 5 day chart looked good and a close for the week over $14 would make the 1 month chart look good. the more I read about this industry and this particular company (putting the management ownership squabble aside which will get resolved) there is not reason why VLDR can't recover most of its losses and make new all time highs before year end. remember COVID was an issue before for the company and i think with vaccination momentum strong, the company will be back on track with production and installation. good luck to all longs!

VLDR's typical price range is $11.49 to $12.89 with an extreme price range of $10.78 to $13.60. Current triple support at $12.15 and single resistance at $13.20. Watch for possible breakdown below $11.46, no support in area just below.

Took a small position in VLDR back in January to see where this was going. Unfortunately, holding on some paper losses. Sold a $15 May 21 covered call to make up some of the paper losses. Will see how this strategy plays out.

Warren Buffett's investing strategy is to buy and hold. He has a reputation for holding onto companies for many years. However that is not the only way he has built up his wealth.

He trades options from time to time to collect premiums while waiting for stocks he loves to hit certain price points.

Good luck all!!!

##############################
People: it's worth LOOKING AT Velodyne's website. Yesterday's announcement appears meaningful. Velodyne is showing it can be a leader in defining how LIDAR products are tested and validated, not just in getting high-end LIDAR into actual usage. I wish that I knew what the impact of fighting all the BS lawsuits will be, but I don't and I assume it's not going to drain the firm of cash. Meanwhile, VLDR keeps doing its job, hiring, pushing ahead. VLDR appears to still be the higher-priced, higher capability LIDAR, in comparison to LAZR and Ouster. I don't know about the lawsuits - but chastising and firing the founder for awful personal behavior is not criminality or fraud. If all these law firms had something solid, it would be IN THEIR PRESS RELEASES - it appears they 'got nothing' on VLDR and if VLDR trounces 1 or 2 of them, the other lawsuits will probably fade...because there are companies out there to be sued that HAVE done bad stuff. The APril 12 announcement with Ansys could turn out to be a 'big deal'. Lidar is big enough that I'm thinking of buying LAZR just to be playing in multiple tiers of the market. Only one of them has to double, to make up for the other going to zero - and they may both double. It's stressful if you - like me - bought VLDR at $18 but this could be a buy opportunity. What besides the lawsuits is holding VLDR down? Any direct comparison shows they are FAR ahead of LAZR. I am betting significant - for me - money on VLDR smashing the lawsuits and being a solid long-term winner in LIDAR.
##############################
##############################
prediction - with so many tech stocks beaten like VLDR and next week is the end of month, quarter...look for a lot of accumulation. VLDR will be over $15 this week.

I remember m shorting amd from 13 all the way to 90

Just stopping in to check on the "it's a great day to buy the dips crowd"
##############################
##############################
While most of these lawsuits are just 'ambulance chasing,' I wonder about a paragraph from this article:

"According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. Certain Velodyne directors failed to maintain an attitude of respect, honesty, integrity, and candor with the Company's officers and directors. The Company had launched investigations into this matter. Based on these facts, the Company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Velodyne, investors suffered damages."

This cloud over the company could last until May 3.
Not selling for now...any thoughts?
##############################
##############################
VLDR is up 13.07% to 12.89
##############################
##############################
With all the lawsuit negative PR going on for VLDR, and hardly any negative PR for LAZR, VLDR is still up over 10%, yet LAZR is down 0.88%. If that doesn't indicate one heck of a strong business potential, not sure what else does.

##############################
##############################
I'm averaged at 14 and I'm still very comfortable with that price. However what some consider to be bargain price, is another person's fair value of the stock. And with Velodyne I'm not sure where we are on that spectrum. Only positive I have at the moment is that I would never be shorting at these prices. You only need a few pieces of PR or a new contract with a big player and that volume would be immense. If a stock has previously been 20+ , then a turn of events can easily bring 30/40% gains in a day. Might have to wait a while though and be patient.

"Last week, Luminar Technologies (LAZR) gave its first business update since becoming a publicly traded entity in December. It‚Äôs safe to say, the market liked the news. Shares gained 16% in the subsequent session as investors digested what‚Äôs in-store for the lidar maker.

Northland analyst Gus Richard was among those impressed.

‚ÄúThe key takeaway is the Company continues to be the leading automotive Lidar company as it moves toward commercialization in 2022,‚Äù said the 5-star analyst. ‚ÄúAlso consistent with our checks LAZR makes a compelling case the designs are sticky as it would be costly to re-write software.‚Äù

##############################
How is competitor LAZR worth nearly 6.7 Billion, while VLDR with actual sales and customers is valued at just $2.5 billion or so. Because of an internal squabble over personal behavior and who gets to control the Board? I am holding all my VLDR and buying on dips - I expect recovery and market share dominance.

##############################
##############################
Unlike other SPAC blow, no changes in VLDR business/fundamentals/revenue model etc. ONLY issue is the chaos between board members and the founder. Mr Hall should act like other company founders (like MS, Google etc etc) and keep the young blood to drive this stock up and up. I hope all come in to some consensus soon. Mr Hall holds 50% of outstanding shares, still holding which is a good sign.

I think this stock will be set right in its position by next ER.

My stock advisor's take on Lidar and VLDR:
"I‚Äôm not worried about the SPACs that are bringing new LIDAR companies into the market. If one of them turns out to be a winner, I‚Äôll buy them too. There‚Äôs no reason not to own more than one. But at this point, Velodyne is the one." Go $VLDR $LAZR

@ BilboBagholder: Thank you for the responsive advice last week: Just as a fyi, based on that feedback I tiptoed into the LIDAR Sector water earlier this morning for the initial time by picking up 400 shares of discounted VLDR @ 11.89. My only regret, at least for today, is that I didn't pick up an investment sized holding.

from Daniel's post of 7 days ago
While my investments have historically been more focused in the stodgy energy arena, and admittedly I've been a little slow on the uptake but LIDAR showed up on may radar last fall as a technology with the staggering growth potential to bring transportation kicking and screaming into the 21st century, but to date I remain on the sidelines. With VLDM and others in seeming freefall as I data entry on the keyboard (14.08 down 1.10), not convinced the market is big enough for all of the would be players in this sector to survive, but just dispassionately looking at the charts, a nice entry point for a pure gambler for this stock would not be until after it breaks into the 12's (- but having been there, done that "holding the bag" thing in other venues in a past life, my sincere sympathies to any of the walking wounded who may have tested the waters a little earlier).

Introductions, gambling & scars aside, looking for the most compelling arguments as to why one would put their faith and money on VLDR (as say contrasted with - take your pick, e.g. LAZR or any other competing player).

Thanks in advance for your input.

SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 29, 2021-- Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (Nasdaq: VLDR, VLDRW) today announced that it has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 (the ‚ÄúRegistration Statement‚Äù) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù).

The Registration Statement is primarily being filed to allow for existing stockholders of Velodyne, not subject to Velodyne‚Äôs Insider Trading Policy, to resell shares upon the expiration of the lock-up agreement that was entered into as part of the business combination with Graf Industrial Corp., which expires on March 29, 2021. The Registration Statement will allow approximately one-third of the stockholders named in the prospectus to potentially resell up to approximately 130 million shares of Velodyne common stock as well as approximately 4.5 million shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants.

Velodyne is not registering the issuance of any new shares of common stock except for those shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of previously issued warrants that are outstanding. Of the shares registered, approximately two-thirds of the shares may not be resold until the trading window under Velodyne‚Äôs Insider Trading Policy re-opens two days following the announcement of Velodyne‚Äôs first quarter results of operations, which is expected to occur in the first half of May 2021. These shares are held by directors, officers, employees and agents (such as consultants and independent contractors) of Velodyne, as well as their immediate families, members of their households, and other related persons.

The Registration Statement relating to these securities has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC. Copies of the Registration Statement (and the preliminary prospectus contained therein) may be obtained from the Company by request at 5521 Hellyer Avenue, San Jose, CA 95138, by visiting the SEC Filings section of Velodyne‚Äôs investor website, or by visiting .

This press release shall not constitute either an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

OK, one day a market doesn't make, and still no complaints, since I'm (gratefully) slightly ahead of the game with (my admittedly, "chump change" position) in VLDR based on a fortuitous delayed entry late last week into the LIDAR sector, but can't help but notice that (for whatever the reasons) in the race for the bottom that at a negative 5.0+% loss so far for the day, VLDR is regretfully easily performing at Worst in Class (when contrasted with daily losses of its peers; i.e., IVP (AEVA) at negative 3.9%; or LAZR at negative 2.5%). Since I'm currently inclined to bottom feed to bring myself closer to an investment grade position, I'm all ears to hear from the VLDR crowd as to the rationales on why "Peace my son, this too shall pass."

Look at the Ladar Technology it is far greater than self-driving vehicles and VLDR is a leader. The fastest growing portion of Ladar Technology is traffic control for cities and will be the fastest growing. VLDR is placing emphasis in that area and others. Autonomous vehicles are in the distant future and will undoubtedly synchronize with city traffic control systems. I would be crazy to sell my shares even though I am currently down and plan on adding shares as the smoke clears from the recent shell explosion.

VLDR is a great company. For better run, management SHOULD solve the issue with Mr Hall, first. Otherwise, investors donot have faith or hesitate.

Oppenheimer - buy rating with PT 30

It needed utmost patience to reach $25 (may be before next ER). But, I still have a feeling it will test 12.88 before that.

Why listen to all the shrapnel the shell has already exploded. It is the future of Ladar that is important and VLDR is a leader in many areas. Loosing Money but holding for the bright future. Appears to me that the founder did not want to be a team player and no team will succeed without a game plan and working together.

Seeing this whole EV market Sell Off, I am very happy I invested long into #VLDR which has actually production, contracts, huge pipe and experience - This one going up for sure again. Not so sure about scams and hypes such as #LAZR #MVIS #QS #RMO #XL #FSR #LMND etc. etc.

However, as it hit 12.2, I load up at around 10$ again - averaging down :))

$Velodyne Lidar Inc LAZR - Luminar Technologies 2019 revenue was 12.6M vs VLDR 2019 revenue of 101M.

LAZR 2020 revenue expectation around 15M vs VLDR 94M

LAZR market cap 10.4B vs VLDR market cap 4.4B..

whichever way I look at it, i feel VLDR is the better play here...its either LAZR is overvalued or VLDR is undervalued right now...just my 2 cents üëçüèª

Go to the summary page and then look in lower right corner for analyst price targets. Of 7 analysts the lii is west target was $16, with an average of $22.14. For those thinking about adding, do so in stages in case we fall further, but this seems like a good place to start.

I‚Äôm an automotive master student. We use velodyne lidar for tests and researchers. They tend to be accurate and liable enough for data processing. I can‚Äôt compare them with others since this is the only lidar I‚Äôve worked with.

What my study teaches me is that we‚Äôre at the beginning of automating cars and other vehicles (and even drones). Lidar is used widely in these sectors and will be used more frequently in the future (5-10 years).

There are of course some ethical conflicts when talking about automation and IoT. But there‚Äôs no need to worry about these subjects since history has proven that uncertainties will be solved eventually. Take a look at mobile phones and computers in the early days; people were skeptical about a lot of things.
##############################
##############################
In 2021, Velodyne will make $151 million in 2021. That is almost six times as high as Luminar‚Äôs forecast of $25.75 million.
Therefore, either VLDR stock is way too cheap or LAZR stock is overvalued.

Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (VLDR) PT Raised to $31 at Craig-Hallum as LiDAR Gains Investor Traction
January 5, 2021 8:53 AM
Craig-Hallum analyst Richard Shannon raised the price target on Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (NASDAQ: VLDR) to $31.00 (from $23.00) ahead of three more LiDAR companies entering the public markets in 1Q21 via SPACs (Aeva, Innoviz and Ouster).

The analyst maintained a Buy rating, stating "VLDR is still the most mature LiDAR maker on the market, with revenues, contract wins, and backlog surpassing or rivaling any other LiDAR maker. In the Auto space, we think investors are underappreciating VLDR‚Äôs success relative to its high-profile competition, and we point to VLDR‚Äôs 8 ADAS wins and 2+ robotaxi contracts (incl. 1 with Baidu) as evidence of its viability there. In its secondary markets of delivery/robotics/industrial/etc., our checks suggest that VLDR is the preferred solution.

All good from here.

Guess no one wants to buy SPAC warrants anymore now that SPACs have been cooled off for couple weeks.

SPACs are more fair to retail investors compared to regular IPOs, they are here to stay and EV is the future.

Everyone talking about Apple. We are not an ANM for Apple. While it may seem out of left field, I find a purchase by Amazon much more likely given what VLDR is best at and what Amazon needs. Even with no buyout, VLDR still sells more Lidar than all competitors combined with half the valuation of Luminar. This company will be just fine, I don't care what the price does short term. It will laugh last.

$VLDR $GRAF Baird analyst Tristan Gerra initiates coverage on Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (NASDAQ: VLDR) with a Outperform rating and a price target of $28.00.

The analyst comments "Velodyne Lidar is a pure play and market share leader in lidars, with unmatched product breadth, strong portfolio of proprietary technologies, a strong design win pipeline supporting a 55% four-year revenue CAGR, and strong engagements including with Tesla. Velodyne Lidar is well positioned to maintain its position as the volume and cost leader ($100 announced ASPs) as the company continues to optimize performance and costs along with its proprietary manufacturing. Lidars will become an integral part of autonomous vehicles' sensor systems, owing to camera limitations."

Recently many controversies on the valuation between LAZR and VLDR. While checking Ouster lidar's investor presentation, I found they made interesting comparison on it.
https://data.ouster.io/downloads/Ouster-investor-presentation_12222020.pdf
Slides : 31-32

(1) EV/Revenue comparison
1) VLDR : 4.4 times based on projected 2024 projected revenue
2) LAZR : 16 times based on projected 2025 projected revenue
Until 2024, Velodyne has real sales projection based on confirmed client contracts, but others ? very little.
(2) Revenue CAGR
1) VLDR : 65.1% ( 2021 - 2024 )
2) LAZR : 188.1% ( 2022 - 2025 )
Currently VLDR has the largest revenue in Lidar market. So CAGR by 2024 or 2025 should be quite lower than others.

The valuation between two should not be compared using EV/Revenue ratio or CAGR, but rather be compared based on revenue projection and EV in 2024 or 2025.

Anyone else finding the warrants to be a very attractive buy right now?

Have been accumulating under $3, expecting that if VLDR goes over $18 (exercise price target) then the warrants will start trading more in line with the stock price.

At $18, I am expecting the warrants to still be selling at some discount, but less. Without a discount they would be worth $4.875.

$18-$11.50 = $6.50 *.75 = $4.875

The balance sheet on VLDR is WAY stronger than LAZR. Much more cash, better growth yoy, much less debt, and less institutional influence. End of year rebalancing.

Think about....just shy of a $3 billion dollar market cap. Great, proven tech with a solid back log of orders.

Apple with its cash war chest could easily buy this company with out even noticing the spare change gone. My opinion FWIW is $20 / share stock price in the short term...3 months or less.

For folks that still do not understand. Hedges can still "borrow" (steal) your shares to continue to short a stock. You can formally direct your brokerage that you do not consent to having your stocks "borrowed" (stolen) though in most likely hood your brokerage will tell you that you consented to this when you signed your agreements. Therefore the best way to stop your stocks from being "borrowed" (stolen interest free to you) set a sell limit for all your shares at 2.5x higher then the current price. And keep doing so.. If your current item doubles, simply cancel the current sell limit order and set a new one @ 2.5x the new current price. This is virtually the only way to keep the Hedge Funds from "borrowing" (stealing) your shares.

How many here know the finer points of the differences in technology between vldr and lazr? If you don‚Äôt ask someone who does. I spent hours with Stanford phd students who are working in the same space. These are not partial or biased investors. But they know what they like. I believed them. So I dumped my gmhi stock. Yes, I missed the run up, but I‚Äôm in vldr for the ne t 4-5 years. Not a day trader. I only day trade tesla. Like I did with Qualcomm, profitably, years ago.

If it was a significant cooking of the books, I doubt that VLDR would have been willing to keep the Halls on as board members with nothing but "remedial training" as opposed to legally seeking a complete disassociation from them. I don't see any lawsuit, just a boutique law firm investigating in case actionable info comes up and it can try to get fees for itself.

Outsight and Velodyne Lidar Strengthen Their Technological Collaboration in Real-Time Lidar Processing

SAN JOSE, Calif. ‚Äì Outsight, specialist in 3D spatial intelligence, and Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (Nasdaq: VLDR, VLDRW), provider of intelligent lidar solutions, today announced they have strengthened their collaboration by developing technologies key for smart cities and smart machines, including mobile robots and autonomous vehicles. This initiative builds on the companies‚Äô partnership, announced in June 2020, to improve the analysis and management of people flow and assets in large crowded environments.

Not sure why Yahoo sometimes lets me post links and sometimes it doesn't. You can view the whole article on Velodyne's website.

Good luck all!!!

I highly respect this stock and management but its wavering/manipulating with low volume nowadays. With very low volume, it was dragged down to 60 cents before market today. Hope management will do something on this, or many retailers will quit.

SEC submission today!

Under the terms of the Graf Industrial warrant agreement, Velodyne has the right to call for redemption of all of the outstanding Graf warrants if the closing
sales price of the Common Stock is at least $18.00 per share on 20 trading days within a 30-day trading period. Velodyne‚Äôs right to call the warrants was achieved on January 5, 2021. The company is evaluating whether or not to call the warrants for redemption, including whether to call the warrants on a
cash or cashless basis.
The Company will provide additional information on the warrants in due course.

Don't worry, FORD has already sold its shares - this explains why the stock didn't rise the last month. Tomorrow probably some anxious people will sell their shares and move to MVIS - but by the end of February this stock will even go higher. It's not a pump and dump, it's a stable company with very good fundamentals. Ford still using Velodyne Lidar - only sold their shares.

I have always had a strict rule about investing in SPACs I don't pay more then 20% on the original spac price. So if its a $10 SPAC i wont pay more then $12, with this strategy the risk is minimal and the chance for gains is great. Most of these SPACs are trading at inflated values based on pure speculation, so when I see people buying a $10 SPAC for over $20 its clear theyre gambling their money not investing, and will take huge losses when the bubble bursts.

VLDR Velodyne Lidar: Leading the autonomous drive, initiating at OP -- Oppenheimer
Analyst Colin Rusch noted, "We are initiating coverage of Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) with an Outperform rating and $21 price target. As the inventor and leading provider of automotive lidar (light detection and ranging), Velodyne is reaching an inflection point as cost and performance have aligned to accelerate commercial adoption of lidar technology. We view its broad portfolio, manufacturing IP, and R&D incumbency position it to retain market leadership, while expanding TAM in non-automotive applications. Following its SPAC raise and transition to a capital-light manufacturing model, we believe Velodyne has sufficient capital to fund growth and deliver positive EBITDA and CF by 2022. Momentum in signed/awarded contracts gives us confidence in it delivering >40% revenue CAGR over the next five years, supporting our $21 target."

The stock dropped in price because PIPE were exercising their right while they doubled their money. There is and there was no bad PR. Also since Wednesday until today more than 18,000,000 shares were traded. It is also fact that there are some PIPE shareholders that do not wish to sell even at $20. Therefore, there millions of shares that were sold by PIPE probably around 10,000,000 and the rest will either hold for long term or sell the days or weeks to come. VLDR will issue it‚Äôs ER on 11/04 after hour. So my guts feeling tells me that they will issue something within the next two weeks regarding their transition as well as possibility of partnership with car manufacturing. Also, this is a tech co and even if the price drops to $15 it will go up soon because they have a track record and they are here to succeed and bring new aspect and new technology to EV sectors. So be patient.

What I‚Äôm beginning to like about VLDR is that the leadership is conscious of the simple marketing maxim! It‚Äôs not enough to do whatever you do and do it well; but you have to show others how totally successful you are in doing it. VLDR is now coming out with regular press releases on the subject, along with technical presentations. Way to go!

First of all, I am longing for VLDR.
For the last month or so, I mean since the merger.......
It goes down when the market is down. Fine, I'm ok with that.
It goes down because of day traders' profit taking. Ok.
It goes down when the market is up, because of all those massive selling by PIPE and insiders, even with recent good news.
What bothers me is why would PIPE and insiders sell when the company has a bright future as people in this forum always say?
When will this go up as it should?
getting tired of waiting.....

Added warrants. We are in the exercise window and even though there's a premium, a good earnings report and guidance and business update should propel the stock and the warrants should follow in sync. If the common was to shoot past 18$ warrants will follow with a $11.50 gap.

##############################
Hey Guys; I'm new to this stock. Just put in a "Pre-Market" order for 100 ("Small Potatoes"; I know, for most of you). I love doing my DD and I've come up with this "Theory". VLDR has in place an agreement with: "Beijing Trunk Technology". They (Beijing Trunk Tech) is designing autonomous driving for big trucks in China. VLDR's equipment to be used on these "Autonomous Chinese Big Trucks"... With me so far? OK; now VLDR has made a deal with "CVG" (Cincinnati's Northern Kentucky Airport) to provide equipment to be used on all their airport "Tarmac" vehicles. Just so happens AMZN is building a "Monster Wing" to CVG's airport. My "Theory" is this... I think CVG approached AMZN; or more likely AMZN approached CVG about paying for VLDR's equipment to be installed in CVG's vehicles to see how well they perform... If all turns out well... My thinking is AMZN might be using VLDR's technology in the future when (NOT IF; BUT "WHEN") AMZN has autonomous trucks on the roads/highways throughout the US... Just think about it. I'm from the NKY (CVG) area and an AMZN employee... Anyway, happy to join this post! "Good Luck"! I'm going "Long" and going to accumulate... Hope "Good News" coming out on 2/25!!!

Why would Hyundai not use Velodyne when they have already devoted so much into their products? This is a done deal. Just needs to be announced as official and this stock will double. Ford will probably use Velodyne also.

Everytime this stock goes into the 16.50 to 17.50 range big sellers come in;
probably those who got the pre GRAF Spac IPO shares are way less then the
IPO price of $10; looks like when it finally drops into the $14 range the selling
dries up. Moral of the story: Buy/add around 14.25 ( which I did ) and sell
25pct of the position when the stock head to the 17 area. Then Wash/Rinse/Repeat and
lower the cost basis of the shares

Got out of LAZR last week (eeked out a slight profit on the way down) and moved the position big into VLDR. There is a whole world outside of autonomous vehicles (which LAZR might have an advantage in the long run) and VLDR seems like a better play in the more broader applications of LIDAR tech

Nice volume and move today. VLDR may be not as exciting as LAZR but I believe of the two, VLDR is more established with millions of revenue already from what I can find. At this point, these two will probably trade in tandem but over longer term we shall see what happens. Looks like they have the technology that is in demand today. God Bless and stay well.

Well, it could also be that they announced the ouster on monday because they have big news tonight and didn‚Äòt want to break the momentum?

In the long run they are the winners - because of patents and experience. And it‚Äòs a good sign they are getting rid of the older guards. They have served but can now retire...

With only 55M share float this one's going to the moon.

##############################
When you look at the valuation of VLDR compared to some of the EV companies that some have little to no revenue and have market caps of $5, 10, 15 billion it looks pretty cheap , and a lot of car companies will be spending billions and billions on technology like VLDR has. VLDR growth is big when you compare valuations in this sector, the stock price will eventually catch up.

Real Analysts reaction -

Velodyne Lidar, Inc. (VLDR) PT Raised to $31 at Craig-Hallum as LiDAR Gains Investor Traction

"Citi starts Velodyne Lidar with Buy on 'early mover advantage' Citi analyst Itay Michaeli initiated coverage of Velodyne Lidar with a Buy rating and $31 price target

Needham Initiates Coverage On VLDR with Buy with $30.0

And, top of that..

Cramer likes Velodyne Lidar Inc (NASDAQ: VLDR) for that crowded space.

Every low, buy buy buy. It will break the momentum at ANY time.

##############################
Ford sold its VLDR shares due to Argo AI.
They invested in VLDR 6 months earlier they decided to invest $1b in Argo AI, and then Argo AI acquired its own Lidar sensor company Princeton Lightwave in 2017.
Now with Argo AI's own Lidar sensor company working in-house and while it saying its Lidar working well for their autonomous driving system, there is no need for Ford to keep their investment in VLDR, especially when they could take 300% profit in 5 years.
Now it's clear why VLDR didn't move up while all other Lidars headed up last week.
##############################
##############################
This downward price action was all triggered by the cashing in of the warrants. VLDR will be ip to $30 soon.
##############################
##############################
Started a small position today in $CCXX at 9.98 that I will hold over to the conversion of Multiplan. Took a look at the presentation again today and based on the way they lay out the vesting of PIPE and founders shares we shouldn't see the relentless selling that to place in $VLDR. The magic number looks like $12.50 for where vesting starts to occur and where we will probably see some additional selling. I think the risk reward here is pretty favorable at this point. I will look to add on any drop after the conversion. Best of Luck

Lets close the day above $17 and end the week up over $18!
Keeping an eye on the $18 mark to know when the warrants can be called
(closes above $18 for 18 out of 20 days I believe is the criteria)
Will the warrants get called in before 2021? I think YES!

VLDR is a young company founded in 2018 and became a public company March 30 of this year. I hope you have done your research before investing and continue to follow its activity like any kind of investment. Not because a stock is down big for few days or up big time for a few days with no change in its story or business that a stock is a failure. No quality stock goes up straight for a long period of time or vice versa because their activity depends on the emotion of their investors unless there is something wrong inside the company. So if you believe in the importance of their products and services as they continue to grow their business then you will be rewarded in the long run. VLDR is a small cap company with very small debt that they can very much manage and at present is collaborating with established well known companies. I do like the concept of their business that is why I invested in their stock. I hope you take advantage of days like these and add to your shares and see it as a long term investment. Have a Merry Christmas and hopefully a better New Year next year.

The stock was up OVER $3 today before the news broke of Mobile Eye dropping LAZR in favor of their own lidar tech under development. VLDR sold off due to shorts taking advantage and WEAK HANDS panicking. This thing will be north of $50 soon. The Mobile Eye news is specific to LAZR, and has ZERO to do with VLDR. In fact, I'll bet that a ton of LAZR shareholders get out and run to VLDR if they truly believe in how this tech is a game changer.

Hyundai Mobis (012330) announced on the 23rd that it has decided to make a strategic investment in Velodyne, a world-class technology in the field of lidar sensors, to mass-produce Level 3 autonomous driving systems and develop Level 4 and 5 autonomous driving technologies.

Hyundai Mobis decided to invest 50 million dollars (approximately 60 billion won) in Velodyne and carry out technological cooperation related to Lida mass production. The two companies plan to mass-produce the level 3 autonomous driving lidar system in 2021 to focus on domestic and Asian markets.

Hyundai Mobis' technology collaboration and investment status related to future vehicle development/provided by Hyundai Mobis
Lida is a key sensor necessary for autonomous driving along with cameras and radar. In particular, it is essential to secure lidar technology in order to preoccupy the global autonomous vehicle market as the most important sensor in level 3 or higher autonomous driving technology, where the dominance of vehicle driving is transferred from human to system.

In an autonomous vehicle, Lida emits a laser (light) and recognizes the environment around the vehicle such as objects or pedestrians with the reflected signal. Using a lidar enables precise recognition at night or in bad weather compared to a camera and radar. It also has the advantage of accurately detecting the distance and speed of a stationary or moving target.

Velodyne is an auto parts company founded in 1983 and has been developing LiDAR products since 2005. Velodyne's LiDAR technology is evaluated to be the most technologically advanced LiDAR currently available for mass production based on its high-resolution analysis capability, miniaturization, and low-power design technology.

Through this technical cooperation, Velodyne plans to supply the latest lidar sensors to Hyundai Mobis. Based on the software developed in collaboration with Hyundai Motor Company (005380), Hyundai Mobis processes the data sensed by LiDAR to finalize the LiDAR system.

really like the selling. I bought ~150K again and will hold for long term. My phd research is LIDAR related and have confidence on it. It is not just for EV, it has many more use cases like 3D map etc. TSLA did not use it because it is too expensive before. Now maybe TSLA will use lidar and camera together since they are much cheaper now. Camera with LIDAR will be the future of EV

WHICH WILL YOU PICK?
VLDR - 100 Million 2020 revenue - 4B cap.
LAZR - 10 Million 2020 revenue - 12 B cap.
VLDR - DEALS Motional deals Hyundai and LYFT!!
Now APPLE wants to get involved with EVs with VLDR in mind!
All is well!!! Maybe at $40 by EOY ! GLTAüëçüòä

Both VLDR and LAZR seem to mirror each other in terms of performance. They both go up together and down together. So better to buy VLDR as the share price is cheaper. Better return per share.

Baidu, Inc said Sunday it will form an intelligent electric vehicle (EV) company and forge a strategic partnership with Volvo parent Geely Automobile Holdings Limited.

Baidu uses Velodyne but Volvo uses Luminar. I have LAZR but took a small position in VLDR today.

So I wonder with this strategic partnership, will they be using Velodyne or Luminar?
##############################
##############################
Serious question here, does any long termers here think this is a $60 stock this time next year? Thanks
##############################
##############################
$vldr will definitely be acquired buy Big Company, with a premium price. If not acquired, Veloyne, is a best of the best. It is a $TSLA in its domain.
It could easily be $150 stock in a near future. Patience 8s a virtue 9f successful investment. If you have conviction as I do, invest and wait, regardless of volatility. Veloyne, is a disruptor and enhancer.

Hi everyone, new to this board and stock. I bought LAZR in the morning rush, but decided to bail after how fast it was rising. From experience at PLTR I saw the writing on the wall that a big pullback will probably happen. Serious question, I‚Äôm in for the long term, and was just wondering where you all see this at a share price in a year, three, five and 10 years? Thanks in advance for the responses!

Now that Halls are out there may be a good chance Velodyne can be taken over by a major automotive. Maybe the Halls screwed up possible takeover by a major automotive. I can't imagine Apple developing their own Lidar with so much money in their bank and so late into the game. My hunch is Apple + Kia + Velodyne trifecta to develop Apple EV.

There is a major imbalance in how the market is valuing VLDR versus its competitors. VLDR is already in the market, selling product, an up and running company. As far as I know, the others are still in product development. Yet VLDR got smashed to an extreme degree. That should only happen if criminal behavior was discovered, as in lying to the SEC and the world, bad accounting, criminal CEO malfeasance - that sort of thing. I wrote to their Investor Relations twice the day they canned the cofounder and his wife - saying "Hey, this would be THE TIME to tell investors if there was potentially criminal behavior, lying about sales and product." No response, no followup... and on the earnings call, not a peep about malfeasance. Which means this: every executive on that call, every director, would know they'd be in very serious trouble if they concealed something more sinister. Conclusion: the cofounder and his wife did something offensive and stupid, but not criminal. In that situation, a 20% selloff might be warranted; after all, this is a company with serious people running it and they don't need the cofounder - and the CMO (wife) is totally replaceable, no loss to cry about there. Conclusion: this selloff makes no sense whatsoever and the analysts predicting $30 are probably right. Decision: buy more (I have naked puts and am down about $5,000 on this collapse) on the assumption that the Board and senior management are neither insane nor criminal. On the earnings call, they were nervous but committed to their strategy of cutting prices to drive adoption - translation: grab customers now before competitors can start those relationships, and get to volume levels fast to kill profits for competitors - accept losses now. There was really no hint of any executive hiding criminality or hiding product failures or major customer losses - although tripling down isn't always smart, this looks like a time when it will be. VLDR resonates like a company that has its act together and will be an attractive takeover target. I'm accepting the risk to buy more at these levels, although I'm unhappy that VLDR has not given more information about what happened - they should announce the cofounder was fired for personal issues not anything fundamental to the business.

Warrant redemption cashless leads me to suspect that ‚Äúpersons unknown‚Äù, are pushing this stock price down with a view to minimising issuance of cashless shares, reducing dilution to a minimum, after which we may see this stock flourish! My 2cents!

Compared to other lidar-stocks way undervalued! This stock here is on sale - and it‚Äòs moving up.

Much bettet fundamentals than #LAZR which is traded at 4x higher... move into #VLDR
##############################
##############################
When F bought 13 million shares of VLDR they were not subject to a customary lockup and could sell on the IPO day. Did they sell? Is that why this shot up to 25 and backed off to 17? F really needs some creative thinking to pay off its huge debt. Be careful out there. Never chase an IPO but buy the dip. The ones that bought must wait to sell so at todays price VLDR appears to be a bargain.
##############################
##############################
First time will hold gains cause I sold

Tristan Gerra said VLDR would be only realistic option Apple would consider. With a market cap half of LAZR and revenue 5x of LAZR, we all know this is gem. You can look at Mr.Gerra previous predictions at the website.

In the end they will all have to come to VLDR !!

Do not underestimate Apple .. they will be in it to win it !!

Based on 7 analysts offering 12 month price targets for Velodyne Lidar in the last 3 months. The average price target is $29.57 with a high forecast of $32.00 and a low forecast of $28.00 - from tipranks reference.

Expect a major price up during the ER on Thursday.

$LAZR $10 billion market cap would mean $65 per $MVIS share (today only $2.82).

$VLDR $3.5 market cap. (is that correct?) means $20 per $MVIS share.

Innoviz $1.4 billion valuation means $10 per $MVIS share.

That is only for the LiDAR business of $MVIS. $MVIS has e.g. also the AR business line (smart glasses, Microsoft Hololens 2) as well as interactive projectors etc.

Another big drop should be enough to get rid of the rest of the profit takers and weak hands. Although right now is also quite a bargain.
##############################
##############################
The fundamentals for LAZR are not, IMHO, as sound as that of VLDR. Financials, proven and accepted technology, partnerships, wider range of day to day acceptability and consumer utility, and of course, current and projected sales revenues, and EBITDA. The one exception seems to be LAZR‚Äôs tie up with GlobalEye (& therein NIO!). To counter that VLDR has WAYMO, Baidu and Ford Otosan. It remains to be seen how the two pan out side by side!
I for one, do not subscribe to the proposition that we hold both! Mainly because LAZR is way too expensive, again IMHO, at this current sp level. If anything, there‚Äôs a case to load up more of VLDR. But I have a ton as it is. Both the stock and even more of warrants! So, I‚Äôll stay dug in and watch!

If LAZR is worth $30 a Share VLDR is worth $60 a share. My guess is bubble will burst on LAZR and VLDR will be the leader in Lidar Technology. In my Opinion smart ones are grabbing profits in LAZR and buying VLDR. I am a small long term investor with no Money in LAZR however being a retired Enginner I see real value in Lidar Technology.

I listened the call, not really good. They said questions only regarding the report they published today evening.

This stock will not see any higher anytime sooner unless issue resolved with Mr Hall.

FYI - David Hall, who with Marta Thoma Hall holds approximately 98,545,299 shares and holds voting control of approximately 58.4% of the outstanding common stock of Velodyne Lidar, Inc.

VLDR - 100 Million 2020 revenue - 4B Mcap.
LAZR - 10 Million 2020 revenue - 12 B Mcap.

UPDATE 3-Sensor maker Velodyne removes founder from chairman post, wife claims 'ambush'
4:26 PM ET, 02/22/2021 - Reuters

(Recasts with Marta Hall comments, adds company response, updates stock)

By Ayanti Bera

Feb 22 (Reuters) - Sensor maker Velodyne Lidar Inc said on Monday it had removed founder David Hall as chairman and his wife Marta Thoma Hall as marketing chief for a lack of honesty, a charge Marta Hall said the couple was not allowed to rebut in a board meeting she described as an "ambush."

Shares of Velodyne, one of several companies vying to supply automakers with lidar, a sensor that generates a three-dimensional map of the road ahead, were down about 15% in afternoon trading. Lidar sensors are a key technology as the auto industry pushes toward self-driving vehicles.

"The investigation concluded that Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall each behaved inappropriately with regard to board and company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with company officers and directors," the company said in a statement.

Velodyne said the actions followed the completion of an investigation by the board's audit committee that began in December.

A Velodyne representative declined to provide further details on reasons for the board's action and the company said it has directed the Halls to receive appropriate remedial training while they continue to serve on the board.

However, Marta Hall described the brief Friday board meeting at which she and her husband lost their jobs as a surprise, and added the blank-check firm, or special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), that took Velodyne public through a reverse merger last fall was trying to cut the Halls out of the decision-making process at Velodyne.

"It was like an ambush," she told Reuters in an interview. "We had no chance to defend ourselves."

Hall defended her and her husband's intention to nominate a board director and compensate that person themselves, saying what she called "an introduction fee" was common for outside nominees.

After Marta Hall's comments, Velodyne said in a statement that the Halls were informed of the probe last month, received notice of the agenda for Friday's meeting, and were given "ample" time to provide their views in the weeks leading up to the board action.

Velodyne said on Monday it had received notice from the Halls of their intent as stockholders to nominate a candidate to the board.

The Halls planned to compensate their proposed director nominee, Eric Singer, in cash, according to the company. Velodyne said it has concerns regarding the compensation arrangement.

David Hall is the largest shareholder of the company with a 35.43% stake as of Feb. 12, according to Refinitiv IBES data, while Marta Hall owns a 3.74% stake.

Last week, James Graf, the chief executive of Graf Industrial Corp, the SPAC that took Velodyne public, stepped down from Velodyne's board. Graf's decision to resign was not due to any disagreement with the company, Velodyne had said in a filing.

Velodyne named Joseph Culkin, who has been a board member since 2016, as chairman, effective immediately, while communications head Sally Frykman took over as chief marketing officer.

I like them both right now. Am sitting on LAZR and VLDR, but my VLDR position happens to be about 2x as large. No reason to not hang on to both. Always ready to adjust position as market conditions change.
